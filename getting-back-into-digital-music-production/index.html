I bought the Standard version of <a href=https://www.ableton.com/en/live/>Ableton Live</a> and I&rsquo;m really motivated to get back into this hobby and actually learn it from the ground up again.</p><p><img src=./ableton-live.png alt="Ableton Live"></p><p>As mentioned, I definitely already have <em>some</em> experience with digital music production - I used to have a once a week course in music school back when I was still taking piano lessons but this is now more than a decade ago (Oh god, I&rsquo;m getting old). Additionally I played around with some DAWs (Cubase and an older version of Ableton, and for a short time FL Studio) but I never took the time to actually learn any of those tools.</p><p>I started playing piano/keyboard when I was 8, and guitar when I was around 18 - I&rsquo;m now 29 - and in all this time I <strong>never actually wrote or recorded a single piece of music</strong>. I definitely played around with some ideas but I never worked on them enough to turn them into a real song.</p><p>But over the last couple of years I actually got some of the hardware that would enable me to do this more comfortably and now that I own a &ldquo;real&rdquo; DAW, there&rsquo;s nothing really stopping me. And I&rsquo;m overall pretty motivated to get into this hobby more - both because I felt that recently I&rsquo;ve kind of neglected my instrument practice and this would definitely help with that, and also because it just seems like a hobby where you also get to learn a worthwhile skill alongside it.</p><p>Initially I think I&rsquo;ll just pick some tutorials from YouTube and follow them to refresh the basics of Ableton Live again. Overall I&rsquo;m actually pretty excited to try all of this out. I&rsquo;ll probably create another blog post soon where I talk about my hardware setup for music production and some things that I&rsquo;d still like to improve about it.</p></main><footer><div class=footer><div class=construction>This site is still a work in progress, some content might be missing or incomplete & the styling might look
