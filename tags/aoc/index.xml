As every year, I start out motivated - this time I wanted to use AoC as an opportunity
to use Go more and get to know the language better - and as every year, I lost motivation within a couple of days and have now basically stopped participating at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall I really like the idea of AOC, especially how many devs from all around the world participate in it. However when it comes to actually doing those challenges every
day, I just get to a point where I really lose the motivation to stick to it. Especially when considering that I&amp;rsquo;m already spending over 8 hours a day programming in my
day job. So when I&amp;rsquo;m done with work for the day, I&amp;rsquo;m often struggling to find the energy to work on something software related in the evening as well.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
