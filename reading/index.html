<div class=book-title>Brief Answers to the Big Questions</div>
<div class=book-details>
Stephen Hawking (2018)
</div>
<div class=book-rating>★★★★☆</div>
<div class=book-review><p>Here&rsquo;s another non-fiction book. This book is a collection of questions mostly about space, the future and technology that Stephen Hawking answers in pretty short chapters. Some questions/answers give insight to his own experiences in his life, both about his work and his personal struggle with his disability, some are about his expectations about the future, for example the impact of the advancement of A.I on humanity.</p>
<p>I expected this book to be drier than it actually was - although some of his answers went into pretty heavy scientific topics, he still managed to explain them in an understandable and often very humorous way.</p>
<p>I also found the afterword by his daughter Lucy, written after Stephen&rsquo;s death, very touching, it was a great end to a cool book! Overall I think it was extremely interesting and I would definitely recommend it!</p>

Osamu Dazai (1939)
</div>
<div class=book-rating>★★★☆☆</div>
<div class=book-review><p>This was very short and pretty weird book. It&rsquo;s mostly just the thoughts and ramblings of a girl that is frustrated and looking for her purpose in life. I find it pretty hard to describe the book because there&rsquo;s not really a storyline, the main character is just reflecting on her current situation and her life & goals in general.</p>
<p>The book is definitely unique but overall I wasn&rsquo;t blown away a bit.</p>

<div class=book-rating>★★★☆☆</div>
<div class=book-review><p>I read this novella pretty spontaneously because I had just really been in a &ldquo;chess mood&rdquo; for the last couple of days.</p>
<p>Overall it was surprising how much of a page turner it actually was and it was a nice to read a Austrian book for a change.</p>
<p>Then again - from an emotional point of view this book hardly touched me so I&rsquo;m giving it 3.5 stars I think. Worth a read but nothing exceptional in my opinion.</p>

<div class=book-details>
Robert Jordan (1990)
</div>
<div class=book-rating>★★★★☆</div>
<div class=book-review><p>Really liked this one. I did take a break of a week or two while I read some different books but overall I like that I got to know the characters even more now and the story is really starting to pick up. I especially enjoyed some of the new friendships that were formed in this one.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have any big criticism when it comes to the pacing, I think it was definitely better than the first one.</p>
<p>Super curious about the next book because I heard that it&rsquo;s one of the best in the series!</p>

<div class=book-title>When Breath Becomes Air</div>
<div class=book-details>
Paul Kalanithi (2016)
</div>
<div class=book-rating>★★★★★</div>
<div class=book-review><p>This book describes the experiences of a neurosurgeon during his time in medical school to residency and then in the second part how he dealt with his lung cancer diagnosis all the way up until his eventual death.</p>
<p>Loved the writing, obviously an incredibly heavy topic but the descriptions of his time as resident in the hospital and his motivations & reasons to become a doctor in the first place were very insightful. It is also remarkable how realistic and brave he stayed during his illness and the book also shows how the diagnosis changed the lives of not only him but also his wife.</p>
<p>I would absolutely recommend this book, I loved it.</p>

<div class=book-title>Lolita</div>
<div class=book-details>
Vladimir Nabokov (1955)
</div>
<div class=book-rating>★★★☆☆</div>
<div class=book-review><p>My first book by Nabokov. My main thoughts: super pretty and flowery writing style - sometimes hard to read for me as a non native English speaker (then again neither was Nabokov).</p>
<p>My main problem with the book wasn&rsquo;t even the obviously problematic/disturbing relationship between the two main characters but mostly that I just didn&rsquo;t really care for the story at some point. I actually took a break of several months before finally finishing this book. There are definitely some quite fucked up scenes & situations in the book; I also didn&rsquo;t think that this book is in any way romanticizing the relationship of the two characters. Humbert knows what he&rsquo;s doing and that what he is doing isn&rsquo;t right, it&rsquo;s just the fact that he&rsquo;s an unreliable narrator that might make this a bit less clear I guess.</p>
<p>Overall, I found it okay. Very pretty writing style, didn&rsquo;t love the story & probably won&rsquo;t reread it.</p>

<div class=book-title>Man's Search for Meaning</div>
<div class=book-details>
Viktor E. Frankl (1946)
</div>
<div class=book-rating>★★★★★</div>
<div class=book-review><p>The first part of the book describes the experiences of the author during his imprisonment in several concentration camps and talks about dealing with the situation there and finding a reason to accept & continue enduring his suffering there. Obviously some very disturbing & tragic description of events there.</p>
<p>The second part was about his general philosophy called Logotherapy. This was definitely more dry, but I liked that for every statement or idea he usually gave several examples of actual cases that prove and explain that idea in a more practical sense.</p>
<p>Overall I found it super interesting & it definitely changes one&rsquo;s outlook on life&rsquo;s meaning to a certain extent. Great book!</p>

<div class=book-title>Meditations</div>
<div class=book-details>
Marcus Aurelius (180)
</div>
<div class=book-rating>★★★☆☆</div>
<div class=book-review><p>This is my first introduction to stoicism and actually the first book on philosophy in general that I read. I read the Gregory Hayes translation which helped a lot - I first tried an older translation that was unecessarily difficult to understand when you&rsquo;re used to modern English.</p>
<p>I found many of the ideas in the book quite interesting and insightful even though I don&rsquo;t agree with all of them. At times the book was quite dry & repetitive but I guess that is to be expected when talking about this topic. Overall I liked it and it was neat to actually read the private notes of a Roman emperor that lived almost 2000 years ago. You don&rsquo;t get to do that every day.</p>

Robert Jordan (1990)
</div>
<div class=book-rating>★★★★☆</div>
<div class=book-review><p>Started reading this book expecting a very slow and dry read but I was suprised how easy to read and engaging this story was. The beginning was definitely a bit slow but soon the story really picks up and the characters are driven by danger and urgency.</p>
<p>The characters are relatable and while they do fit some stereotypes as far as fantasy books are concerned, I did not find this to be detrimental to the story.
I&rsquo;ve heard some opinions that this is Robert Jordan&rsquo;s weakest book in the series as far as writing style and prose is concerned but honestly if that&rsquo;s the case then I&rsquo;m absolutely looking forward to the rest of the series because I actually already really enjoyed the writing in this one.</p>
<p>The ending did feel quite rushed and came a bit too suprising for my taste but overall I liked the book and will continue with the series.</p>

I guess it&rsquo;s just not my style of humor but I probably won&rsquo;t be continuing this series. I guess it&rsquo;s nice to now have some info on some references in pop-culture but overall it just didn&rsquo;t really blow me away.</p>

<div class=book-details>
George Orwell (1945)
</div>
<div class=book-rating>★★☆☆☆</div>
<div class=book-review><p>I get the overall message, but I just found it way too predictable and just like with 1984 I just don&rsquo;t really love Orwell&rsquo;s writing style. All in all I think it&rsquo;s worth the read though, even if it&rsquo;s just for the references in popular culture and general idea and political allegory.</p>
<p>If it hadn&rsquo;t been such a super short read I would have probably quit reading it.</p>

<div class=book-review><p>Almost skipped this one because it&rsquo;s technically optional to read this novella when looking at the whole series. Glad I didn&rsquo;t though, really enjoyable read even though it might not be as &ldquo;big&rdquo; as the other books.</p>

<div class=book-details>
Erich Maria Remarque (1929)
</div>
<div class=book-rating>★★★★☆</div>
<div class=book-review><p>Finally a book I was able to read in its original language. It portraits the naivety with which these young men went to war, looking at it as some sort of adventure which then turned into bleakness. The writing style definitely felt dated but then again this book was written fairly shortly after the war. Would absolutely recommend it, probably one of best (anti) war books I&rsquo;ve read.</p>

H.P. Lovecraft (1931)
</div>
<div class=book-rating>★★★☆☆</div>
<div class=book-review><p>The book is structured as a series of letters describing some supernatural events happening. Some pretty creepy parts but overall I found the writing style a bit too dry. It was also my first Lovecraft book so I think some references to his &ldquo;universe&rdquo; went over my head. Overall it was pretty nice though.</p>

<div class=book-review><p>Really fun book! If you enjoy the xkcd comics, you&rsquo;ll enjoy this book too. Each chapter answers some silly question in a pretty scientific way. It&rsquo;s easy to just pick it up every now and then because each chapter can basically stand on its own.</p>

<p>The writing style is very easy to follow and the book was a page turner. Definitely recommend it!</p>

<p>I might give it a re-read at some point.</p>

<div class=book-rating>★★★★☆</div>
<div class=book-review><p>Really unique writing style, the story itself wasn&rsquo;t actually a big part of the book. I felt like the relationships between the characters were the main focus. Definitely felt quite relatable at times.</p>
<p>One thing I found off-putting was the overly sexual themes at times. Seems like the main character has a sexual relationship with pretty much every other female character he interacts with. Kind of felt forced/unfitting more often than not.</p>

<div class=book-rating>★★★★☆</div>
<div class=book-review><p>Loved the way the writing style changes simultaneously with the mental state of the main character while the story progresses, first time I read something like that. In general the ending was kind of spoiled or at least too predictable by the synopsis and general descriptions of the book.</p>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t have the deep emotional impact on me as it seems to have on a lot of readers but I would overall still absolutely recommend it.</p>

<div class=book-review><p>Loved the writing style and the way the story switches between the two different viewpoints of the main characters. I definitely remember thinking that the prose was really beautiful.</p>
<p>Only negative point for me personally was the ending, I felt like it would have been better if the book had ended a bit earlier, the last part felt kind of tacked on and didn&rsquo;t really fit with the feel of the rest of the book.</p>
