As every year, I start out motivated - this time I wanted to use AoC as an opportunity to use Go more and get to know the language better - and as every year, I lost motivation within a couple of days and have now basically stopped participating at all.\nOverall I really like the idea of AOC, especially how many devs from all around the world participate in it. However when it comes to actually doing those challenges every day, I just get to a point where I really lose the motivation to stick to it. Especially when considering that I\u0026rsquo;m already spending over 8 hours a day programming in my day job. So when I\u0026rsquo;m done with work for the day, I\u0026rsquo;m often struggling to find the energy to work on something software related in the evening as well.\nAnother reason is that while these tasks are overall quite short and focused on one specific topic, they can actually get quite complicated when it comes to catching all the edge cases (especially in part 2 of most tasks). So I often ask myself if it is worth using my free time to solve these problems instead of at least working on an actual pet project that I\u0026rsquo;ll continue working on for a longer time.\nI have to admit that it\u0026rsquo;s mostly laziness \u0026amp; a lack of energy.\nHowever, it turns out that I\u0026rsquo;m substantially worse in Go than I thought lol - initially didn\u0026rsquo;t want to do the exercises in a language that I knew better, like C# for example. But already on the second day I started to switch to C# in order to at least get some of the exercises done at all. Go does some stuff quite differently than I\u0026rsquo;m used to (I can\u0026rsquo;t modify a string in a for loop, really?), so I struggled with topics that would be a no-brainer in C#.\nSo I definitely need more practice with Go \u0026amp; I\u0026rsquo;m probably quitting Advent of Code for this year at least.\n","title":"Advent of Code \u0026 laziness","url":"/advent-of-code-and-laziness/"},{"content":"","title":"Aoc","url":"/tags/aoc/"},{"content":"","title":"Code","url":"/tags/code/"},{"content":"So, I think I\u0026rsquo;ve finally managed to get a working setup for Neovim keybindings in VSCode going. In fact, I\u0026rsquo;m not only using the Neovim keybindings - I\u0026rsquo;m actually running Neovim inside VSCode.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been checking out this Neovim plugin for VSCode. Here Neovim is used for the actual code editing but you still have a normal Visual Studio Code experience. After a bit of tinkering - it seems that I now have a setup with which I can actually be productive while getting the best of both worlds.\nFor Neovim, I\u0026rsquo;m using LazyVim and its developer folke just recently put out an additional feature called extras, which also includes one for VSCode. This basically disables all the existing plugins except for some very basic ones that are useful for purely text editing and wouldn\u0026rsquo;t mess things up when using Neovim inside VSCode. It also sets some useful keybindings that make using VSCode feel more like Neovim.\nSo now I basically didn\u0026rsquo;t have to mess up my existing Neovim config at all, just needed to enable this extra and pretty much everything seems to work out of the box.\nall the usual vim keybindings work out of the box my personal keybindings from Neovim are now available when editing text in VSCode the plugin that let\u0026rsquo;s me jump around in a file comfortable (leap or flash, idk which one is used in the extra exactly), works out of the box which has been a big pain point when using VSCode without it (the color highlighting is still a bit weird but I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;ll find a way to fix it, it\u0026rsquo;s not a dealbreaker for now) the common vim commands are autofilled and shown in a little dialog withing VSCode SPC + SPC opens a fuzzy file picker (even though it can\u0026rsquo;t beat the speed of the file picker in Neovim) This means I don\u0026rsquo;t need to unlearn/relearn any muscle memory when jumping between Neovim and VSCode + I get the benefit of having a easy and mostly automatic setup of debugging and testing for basically any language I want to use. I tried it out for a bit in a Go project and it all just seems to work. I\u0026rsquo;ll play around in a C# project too and see if everything seems fine there too.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll eventually still go through all the settings in the VSCode plugin once again and check if I can improve some stuff but for now it seems like I\u0026rsquo;ve finally managed to find a setup that let\u0026rsquo;s me work comfortably. Super happy about that.\nMaybe this means I\u0026rsquo;ll finally start working on actual projects again instead of fucking around with my editors all the time. Haha.\n","title":"My Neovim in VSCode setup","url":"/vscode-neovim-setup/"},{"content":"","title":"Neovim","url":"/tags/neovim/"},{"content":"A quick overview of what I\u0026rsquo;m using as my personal knowledge base and to-do list.\nLast year in may I wrote about Obsidian as my personal knowledge base. I\u0026rsquo;ve actually been using it ever since and it\u0026rsquo;s become a really nice tool to keep track of basically everything text based in my life that is not specifically source code.\nAdditionally I\u0026rsquo;ve also been looking for (and found) a better way to handle my to-do list and general tasks. I went from using just pen \u0026amp; paper in a little notebook, to using Google Tasks, to now finally settling on TeuxDeux.\nAnd just this week I\u0026rsquo;ve been looking into a better way to save articles for reading them later and I\u0026rsquo;ve stumbled upon Omnivore.\nObsidian Obsidian has become one of my most used pieces of software these days. I\u0026rsquo;ve moved basically any type of text-based documents into my Obsidian vault. A week or two ago I finally made the leap to buy Obsidian Sync - and I don\u0026rsquo;t regret it so far (even though the price can be considered a bit steep at roughly 8$ per month when buying the yearly subscription).\nBut now that I am able to comfortably use it on my phone too I\u0026rsquo;ve been getting even more into it. I\u0026rsquo;m currently looking into more ways to improve my workflow in Obsidian and checking out some additional plugins - but the main selling point for me is just having a comfortable way to manage all of my notes in one place and not necessarily needing to worry about subfolders and where I\u0026rsquo;m putting my notes exactly. I can just create them and link them by topic instead.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also endless ways to customize it, I can use templates (for example for book reviews, journal entries, blog posts for this website) and it\u0026rsquo;s overall also just a great markdown editor.\nMy main uses for Obsidian are:\nday to day notes -\u0026gt; I just have a \u0026ldquo;notepad\u0026rdquo; file where I jot down what\u0026rsquo;s going on, things I want to remember, basically anything that crosses my mind and I want to record journal -\u0026gt; I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to get back into journaling regularly, decided to go the digital route now so Obsidian has been very comfortable, especially now that I can create journal entries on my phone too. Currently I just have one note per week and notes for each month \u0026amp; year. A separate note for each day just got too messy and felt like overkill because most days I don\u0026rsquo;t write a whole lot anyways book reviews -\u0026gt; I have a template for book reviews that I use for this website and I also copy the content of them into Goodreads usually programming notes -\u0026gt; I usually take notes when learning a new programming language And of course just basically any other topic I can think o - if it\u0026rsquo;s text based, it goes into Obsidian.\nTeuxDeux As I said, for a while I moved all of my notes \u0026amp; to-do list to an actual paper notebook. I loved the aspect of just writing down all the things I want to get done today and be able to tick them off. However there were always two big downsides to doing this the analog way:\nhaving to manually move tasks from one day to the next difficult to track appointments and tasks for specific dates across multiple pages TeuxDeux basically solved this problem completely for me. It is genuinely pretty much perfect for the way I\u0026rsquo;d like to handle my to-do list.\nExcuse the pretty heavy censoring - but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to share all my tasks on it publicly :D But TeuxDeux has been such a great tool over the recent months. I love the way the layout works: you have your calendar view at the top, and at the bottom you have custom lists. So for each day I can drag and drop the tasks I want to tackle this day and any tasks that are left over at the end of the day are automatically moved to the next one.\nIt might look pretty minimal \u0026amp; simple, but that\u0026rsquo;s pretty much why I prefer it over other to-do apps. The only thing that it\u0026rsquo;s missing in my opinion would be the option to actually get reminders \u0026amp; notification for tasks - but generally the calendar view makes up for it because I can see upcoming tasks at least a couple days in advance. And long term appointments go into my calendar anyways, not my to-do list.\nYou can format the tasks with some markdown options, you can create subheaders and create repeating tasks. Overall this feels closest to what I would be doing with pen and paper - but without any of the downsides.\nI\u0026rsquo;m working with several categories so I can handle the majority of what I have to do just by looking at this first screen - but you could create a lot more sub-pages and you even have tabs at the bottom that let you organise these lists in more detail. I have lists for general tasks that don\u0026rsquo;t have a specific date, one list for my habits (mostly just to keep them in mind - these don\u0026rsquo;t really get ticked off), one for shopping lists (groceries and long-term \u0026ldquo;wish lists\u0026rdquo;), one for media in general (books, movies/tv, games - basically any kind of tasks concerning these topics) and one for general ideas and low priority tasks.\nAnd on the other two tabs I have one group of task-lists for software development in general (projects I\u0026rsquo;m working on, ideas, changes to my setup), and for now I have another list for things I want to change and improve in Obsidian. It\u0026rsquo;s just really nice to be able to separate different types of tasks so I don\u0026rsquo;t get overwhelmed and lose track of what\u0026rsquo;s important.\nGenerally I\u0026rsquo;m managing and organising the tasks mostly on the web app, and the mobile app is just for actually ticking off tasks during the day.\nI absolutely love TeuxDeux - the web app is actually not free, there\u0026rsquo;s a yearly subscription but considering how much I\u0026rsquo;m using this every day it is absolutely worth it for me.\nOmnivore This is actually a tool that I\u0026rsquo;ve just started using recently. For a while I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Pocket by Firefox as my \u0026ldquo;save for reading later\u0026rdquo; app - but a week or two ago I stumbled across Omnivore on Hackernews.\nThe main things that made me give it a shot were the fact is completely free (NO paid options at all for now), open source and that you can sign up with just email/password, you\u0026rsquo;re not forced to use your Google account or something similar like with many other similar apps.\nAnd: it has an official Obsidian plugin that let\u0026rsquo;s you import saved articles as nicely formatted markdown notes in Obsidian. You can specify exactly how you want the note to look, where you want it to be saved and what content should be shown - directly in the plugin settings in Obsidian.\nSo now I can comfortably move any article I find online into Obsidian with just one click - copy the specific parts of the article into some other note in Obsidian - and then just delete the auto generated note. From what I\u0026rsquo;ve seen so far while trying it out, notes that were synced once and then deleted or archived are not synced again, so my Obsidian vault won\u0026rsquo;t get cluttered with old articles from Omnivore.\nI still need to play around with this more (and there is the overall question how Omnivore wants to sustain it\u0026rsquo;s business - I guess they\u0026rsquo;ll have to add some paid features in the long run, hopefully things that just give you additional benefits and don\u0026rsquo;t downgrade the current experience. Then again, there is the option to self host your own Omnivore instance which could be an option if they ever start asking for money to use their own hosted version). But from a first look, it seems pretty great. I love the Obsidian integration, and the mobile \u0026amp; web app work fine and let you save articles with just one click and read them in there as well. Pretty happy with it.\n","title":"My Obsidian / Teuxdeux / Omnivore setup","url":"/my-obsidian-teuxdeux-omnivore-setup/"},{"content":"","title":"Obsidian","url":"/tags/obsidian/"},{"content":"","title":"Omnivore","url":"/tags/omnivore/"},{"content":"","title":"Software","url":"/tags/software/"},{"content":"","title":"Teuxdeux","url":"/tags/teuxdeux/"},{"content":"","title":"Tools","url":"/tags/tools/"},{"content":"I just noticed that it has been two years (8th of October 2021) since I\u0026rsquo;ve set up this website.

At least on weekends. I\u0026rsquo;m already looking at a screen for 8+ hours a day at work \u0026amp; pretty much every weekday evening as well. So maybe restricting myself (when it comes to programming) to only Monday to Friday could be an option.\nObviously this is not a hard rule - just a general intention.\nSo yeah, I\u0026rsquo;m basically just rambling now but I\u0026rsquo;ll try to actually stick to updating this blog more regularly!\n","title":"Reviving this blog","url":"/reviving-this-blog/"},{"content":"I finally got around to setting up a way to manage my dotfiles - using a Git bare repository.

If a config file is still exactly the same way it was after I installed Manjaro, I don\u0026rsquo;t really see why I should track it.\nI also want to clean up my .bashrc file before commiting because there\u0026rsquo;s a suprising amount of weird stuff in there already.\nBut all in all I\u0026rsquo;m pretty happy with the result, now I can finally start tidying up all my config files.\n","title":"Managing dotfiles","url":"/managing-dotfiles/"},{"content":"Some thoughts on Digital Minimalism and my plans on how I am going to try to (hopefully) embrace this mindset a bit more in my personal life and be more mindful about my technology use.\nI\u0026rsquo;m currently reading Digital Minimalism by Cal Newport because I\u0026rsquo;ve been interested to cut down my phone usage in general. So I thought I\u0026rsquo;d write a blog post about my plans and general ideas on how I want to want to achieve that.\nDecluttering my phone As my first step I decided to clean out my phone \u0026amp; uninstall all the apps that I found are unnecessary and taking up too much of my time or giving me too many notifications \u0026amp; distractions throughout the day.\nWhile I removed some apps like Twitch or Discord that would often interrupt me, I still haven\u0026rsquo;t managed to make myself uninstall Reddit because it\u0026rsquo;s my go-to app when I\u0026rsquo;m bored to be honest.\nI also set up the \u0026ldquo;always-on-display\u0026rdquo; on my phone to show me this sort of activity view that interrupts this colorful bar whenever you unlock and use your phone. So the more black space you have in this bar, the more you\u0026rsquo;ve been using your phone throughout the day.\nThe idea is that this will maybe just give me a little more incentive to not unlock my phone unless it\u0026rsquo;s actually necessary.\nAnalog note-taking Another idea that I\u0026rsquo;ve had is to try and move most of my note-taking to a paper notebook that I carry with me in my pocket. I\u0026rsquo;ve been carrying a little Moleskine notebook for more than a year now. So far I\u0026rsquo;ve been using it for random notes, shopping lists and to-do items and I want to really put more effort into using it more.\nMaybe I\u0026rsquo;ll even look into Rapid Logging in order to be more efficient with my note taking \u0026amp; have an easier time keeping track of notes over multiple days.\nThen every night, I could transfer the most important notes back to my Obsidian vault in order to have them backed up and searchable.\nComputer-only apps I\u0026rsquo;ve also decided to move some apps off my phone and use them exclusively on my computer instead. Two examples are as mentioned above Twitch and Discord. I don\u0026rsquo;t really need either app on my phone. Discord is something I mostly use when it comes to gaming which I do exclusively on my computer and Twitch just seems like an app that can easily distract me on my phone while I don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily mind having it open on a second screen on my computer while I\u0026rsquo;m doing something else.\nReading instead of random scrolling Reading has been a huge hobby for me throughout my life and now that I got a Kindle in 2018 I\u0026rsquo;ve been taking it a lot more seriously again.\nBy cutting down on random scrolling, I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to spend more time reading something I\u0026rsquo;m actually enjoying rather than just wasting time looking at random stuff online, for example on Reddit.\nOne screen at a time I\u0026rsquo;m also going to try and stick to looking at only one screen at a time. So for example if I\u0026rsquo;m watching a movie, I want to focus specifically on that without taking my phone out every now and then. Same goes for YouTube videos or while I\u0026rsquo;m reading.\nSpending some time without screens every day Lastly, I want to make it a conscious habit to spend some time away from screens every day.\nI\u0026rsquo;m already looking at a monitor for more than 8 hours per day during work and then obviously still a lot in my free time so I\u0026rsquo;m going to set a rule for myself to get away from any screens for a little bit every day. For example I could use my workouts as an easy way to make that happen \u0026amp; on rest days I could still go for a walk and either leave my phone at home or just use it to play an audiobook or music without actually taking it out of my pocket.\nThis post was mostly rambling but I feel like it helped to organize my thoughts about this topic. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how well I\u0026rsquo;ll actually be able to stick to my new goals.\n","title":"Digital Minimalism","url":"/digital-minimalism/"},{"content":"","title":"Minimalism","url":"/tags/minimalism/"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been interested in personal knowledge base systems recently. After reading about several different ones, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to give Obsidian a shot \u0026amp; try moving all my existing notes there \u0026amp; set up an Obsidian vault from scratch.\nObsidian is a personal knowledge base that is based on markdown files. This is one of the main reasons why I wanted to give it a shot. While the software itself isn\u0026rsquo;t open source, it at least doesn\u0026rsquo;t use a proprietary format that would keep me locked into their system if they ever decide to give up development on the app.\nThe whole idea of Obsidian is to create links between notes in order to connect them by topic - this can then also be shown in a pretty fancy graph.\nFrom playing around with it a bit yesterday \u0026amp; today, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty impressed so far. It has a couple nice plugins + support for community plugins - for example I already have one installed for Git integration which lets me comfortably back up this whole vault to a private GitHub repository.\nI\u0026rsquo;m still deciding how to set it up in general \u0026amp; I want to make sure to only add notes \u0026amp; content that are actually still relevant to me now. I could probably also use Obsidian as my main way to write the content for this website - Hugo also uses Markdown files for the main content. So I could basically mirror everything on here \u0026amp; just publish the content that I\u0026rsquo;d actually want to be publicly accessible.\nI\u0026rsquo;m curious if I\u0026rsquo;ll actually stick to it and continue using it. I really like the idea of having all my notes in one place.\n","title":"Trying out Obsidian","url":"/trying-out-obsidian/"},{"content":"I changed the domain for this website! It can now be reached at matkv.dev. Previously it was my full name + \u0026ldquo;.com\u0026rdquo; but I decided to change it because I feel more comfortable sharing this domain on various sites without having to actually reveal my full name.\nHowever, my old domain still works \u0026amp; now just redirects to this new one - I think I\u0026rsquo;ll keep paying for it just so that nobody else can steal it from me :D And it\u0026rsquo;s also nice to have a fairly professional looking email address that I can use this way.\nThe setup itself was a breeze, I was able to basically just copy the settings from my old domain and set them for the new one. So far everything works as expected.\nA fun fact that I learned, when using a domain with the .dev top level domain, you apparently have to use https \u0026amp; a SSL certificate. But this was pretty easy to set up with my domain provider.

In the last couple of weeks my main two projects have been this website \u0026amp; learning Rust. I did finish my little Rust project that plays a sound to wake up my studio monitor speakers, but apart from that I just keep abandoning all the side projects I start.\nToday I started playing around with a C#/ASP.NET project to solve a Knight\u0026rsquo;s tour problem. Maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll keep working on that in order to get a better understanding of ASP.NET because we also use this framework at work. Some ideas for the functionality that I\u0026rsquo;d like to implement would be:\nGraphical chessboard Interactively position the knight on the board by clicking on any square Show the path that has been calculated visually by having the knight piece follow the path on the board But to be quite honest I\u0026rsquo;m not even sure if ASP.Net is a good choice for something like this. I\u0026rsquo;ll just try it out. There are apparently several ways to solve the Knight\u0026rsquo;s tour problem with code, some are brute-force, there\u0026rsquo;s a divide-and-conquer algorithm and some fancier stuff with neural networks. I\u0026rsquo;ll probably try out the divide-and-conquer method or the Warnsdorff\u0026rsquo;s rule.\nOr most likely I\u0026rsquo;ll just forget about this project and abandon it eventually :D\n","title":"Current Projects","url":"/archive/current-projects/"},{"content":"There is a custom blog type for this website now - this means it is possible to create a blog post with just one command.

I\u0026rsquo;ll quickly document what I did so that I don\u0026rsquo;t forget it again.\nHugo basically looks in the \u0026ldquo;theme/matkv/archetypes\u0026rdquo; directory to figure out what kind of content types exist for the site.\nSo I created a new archetype for my projects. I created a subfolder called \u0026ldquo;projects\u0026rdquo; and in this folder there is another subfolder \u0026ldquo;image\u0026rdquo; which will be used for a cover image for each project, and then just an \u0026ldquo;index.md\u0026rdquo; file for the actual content of the project site.\nBy using archetypes, I can set up all the tags and properties that I want my \u0026ldquo;project\u0026rdquo; type to have. I just need to do this once in the archetype and everytime I create this type of content dynamically, all the properties will be set by default.\ntype: \u0026#34;project\u0026#34; layout: \u0026#34;project\u0026#34; coverimage: image/cover.jpg In my layouts folder, I then set up a default html file that should be used by each project post. This is why it was necessary to define the \u0026ldquo;layout\u0026rdquo; parameter in the archetype. I also set up a subfolder called \u0026ldquo;projects\u0026rdquo; and defined how I want a list of these projects types to look. For example, I set up a different look for my list of projects than for my list of blog posts. This also allowed me to fix the wrong title for the blog list by creating another custom list type for all my blog posts.\nIn the layouts for both the list and the single page view for a project, I also used the \u0026ldquo;coverimage\u0026rdquo; parameter that I defined in the archetype to link to an image that is stored for each project in the subfolder /image/cover.jpg\nNow I can already create two different kinds of content types dynamically on this website.\nblog posts: hugo new -k blog blog/this-is-my-title.md projects: hugo new -k project projects/test-project I have to specify the file type for blog posts (.md) because otherwise hugo will create a folder which is not what I want in this case.\n","title":"Custom project type","url":"/archive/custom-project-type/"},{"content":"This is my first blog post.
