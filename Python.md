**Table of contents**

* Un-numbered table of contents
{:toc}

## Basic Info

Ctrl + Shift + F10 runs the currently selected script in the console.

Expressions are made up of values and operators. They always evaluate down to a single value. Every value belongs to one data type. Comments are added using "#".

In a Python script, we can wait for user input by using ```input()```.

The ```str()``` and ```int()``` functions return a string/int. ```float()``` returns a float value.

For example:
```python
print('I am printing ' + str(int(numberVariable) + 1))    

#int() takes the content of numberVariable as an int
#str() turns it all into a string
```

### Strings

In Python, strings are defined by using ' ' single quotes. Strings can be concatenated by using a "+" and replicated using a "*".

```python
'Alice' + 'Bob'       #This will return 'AliceBob'
```

```python
'Alice' * 3       #This will return 'AliceAliceAlice'
```

If we want to get the length of a string, we can use the ```len(myString)```function.


## Flow Control

### Boolean

Two values: True & False (they need to be typed with a capital T or F)

#### Boolean operators

Check truth table. AND, OR, NOT...

### Comparison operators

They evaluate to a boolean value. 

```python
 ==
 !=
 <
 >
 <=
 >=
```


Integers and strings are always not equal to each other. Float values and integer values can be equal to each other.

### If - else - elif

```python
name = 'Alice'
if name == 'Alice':
  print('Hi Alice')
print('Done')
```

If the condition is true, the indented code is executed, otherwise the non indendet code is executed.

New blocks (part with new intendation) begin only after statements that end with a colon like in the IF statement.

```python
password = 'swordfish'
if password == 'swordfish':
  print('Access granted.')
else:
  print('Wrong password.')
```

Elif can follow an if statement. It let's us check for multiple conditions. As soon as one condition is met, all the other if statements are skipped. This means the order of the conditions **matter*.

```python
name = 'Bob'
age = 3000
if name = 'Alice':
  print('Hi Alice')
elif age < 12:
  print('You are not Alice, kiddo.')
```

When we set a variable based on ```input()``` a **blank string** would return false, all the other strings return true. For numbers, **0** or **0.0** return false, all others return true. ```bool(0)``` would return false.

### While loops

```python
test = 1
while test < 5:
  print('Hello world!')
  test = test + 1
```

```python
name = ''
while name != 'matko':
  print('Please type your name.')
  name = input()
print('Thank you')
```

```break``` causes our execution jump out of the loop.

```continue``` jumps back to the start of the loop and reevaluates our loop's condition.
