Since I was planning to use it for gaming and also for music production, I decided to go with Windows 11 as my OS and overall I don&rsquo;t regret it. Especially my setup with Ableton Live for music production would not have been possible on Linux.</p><p>However this now means that I&rsquo;m back to Windows after using Linux as my main OS on my personal computer for several years. But now that I&rsquo;ve set up Arch Linux on WSL I have to say that this has definitely removed <em>most</em> of the stuff that I was missing. Sure, I loved KDE as my desktop environment but at least this way I get to basically keep using the terminal as if I was still runing &ldquo;normal&rdquo; Linux.</p><p>So I&rsquo;ve set up my dotfiles repo again as a bare repo and I get to keep using Neovim and Zellij and all the other applications that I&rsquo;ve set up previously. The setup process has been really easy because the switch from Manjaro to Arch really isn&rsquo;t big. It definitely feels good that all the effort I&rsquo;ve put into setting up my dotfiles now hasn&rsquo;t been for nothing and I basically get to keep using them just as I did before.</p><p>The integration of WSL in VSCode has also been extremely smooth - I&rsquo;ve for example moved the repo for this website to this WSL &ldquo;machine&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m doing all development for it through VSCode accessing WSL. It&rsquo;s <strong>really</strong> nice to work in VSCode while having the Arch Linux terminal (directly within VSCode). I&rsquo;m planning to move all my dev projects that don&rsquo;t <strong>need</strong> to be on Windows over there to keep my Windows Install as clean as possible.</p><p>Overall - I&rsquo;m really happy with this setup for now. I&rsquo;ve mostly stopped messing with my config and editors for now and have actually just been working on some dev projects recently.</p><p>Currently my main projects are:</p><ul><li><a href=https://github.com/matkv/playlist-quickadd>Playlist QuickAdd</a> - A Windows App (WinUI) that is supposed to help me manage my Spotify playlists.</li><li>Learning Go - currently still going through some books and general tutorials but I want to find some actual project ideas for Go other than my small <a href=https://github.com/matkv/utils>utils</a> project.</li><li>Complete rewrite of this website - trying to focus on not splitting up the content into different content types and overall keeping the backend a lot cleaner than it is right now.</li></ul><br><div class=blogbacktolist><a href=/blog>« Back to overview</a></div></div><div class=footer><p>© 2023 | matkv</p></div></body></html>
