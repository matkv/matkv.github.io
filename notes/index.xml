Maybe using tui to build the UI in the command line &amp;amp; communicating with the Lichess API to fetch the data.</description></item><item><title>Raspberry Pi project ideas</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/notes/raspberry-pi-project-ideas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/notes/raspberry-pi-project-ideas/</guid><description> mirror of my GitHub profile with regularly scheduled backups or just a local git server a syncthing device with local harddrive Kodi / Plex client (but I wouldnâ€™t really be able to watch 4K content because the Raspberry probably won&amp;rsquo;t be powerful enough to play it without stuttering)</description></item><item><title>Website improvements</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/notes/website-improvements/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/notes/website-improvements/</guid><description>Some ideas for content that I want to put on this website:
