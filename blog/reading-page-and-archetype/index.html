I actually wrote a little C# program to automatically convert the exported csv from Goodreads into Markdown files that have the exact format that I need for this website.</p><p>The finished result can be seen <a href=https://matkobusljeta.com/reading>here</a>!</p><p>This was actually the first <em>useful</em> program that I wrote with .NET core, haha. I used the <a href=https://joshclose.github.io/CsvHelper/>CsvHelper</a> library to read the exported csv. Overall the code is definitely not very clean because this whole project was just meant to be a quick one-time way to convert my Goodreads list into the markdown files. Initially I thought about keeping that project public & open source but considering I used that library I just don&rsquo;t wanna deal with looking up all the license stuff to be honest.</p><p>I created <strong>custom parameters</strong> for the book hugo archetype that were filled out automatically by my C# &ldquo;book&rdquo; object in the program:</p><ul><li>book title</li><li>author</li><li>date finished</li><li>publication year</li><li>my rating</li><li>my review</li></ul><p>The hardest part about this little project was actually cleaning up the csv file that was exported. I had issues with the double quotes, it used &ldquo;,&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;;&rdquo; as the separator which made things unnecessary difficult when splitting the values up and the book titles also had some formatting issues that I needed to clean up with the code.</p><p>All in all I feel like I learned quite a bit doing this, I definitely understand the archetypes better now and I&rsquo;m able to get things done more quickly in Hugo now. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll really need to use this custom program again because now I can just create a new book review with the normal &ldquo;hugo new -k book reading/enter-book-title-here&rdquo; command and then I should already get a nicely formatted markdown file with all the necessary properties that I just need to fill out.</p><p>This was definitely a fun little project and I&rsquo;m happy that it worked out so well :D</p><br><div class=blogbacktolist><a href=/blog>Back to overview</a></div></div><div class=footer><p>© 2022 | Matko Bušljeta</p></div></body></html>
