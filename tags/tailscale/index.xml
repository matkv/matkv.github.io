This allows you to access them from anywhere as if they are on the same local network.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the main usecases for me would be to be able to access my dev projects on my phone while I&amp;rsquo;m working on them on my Windows desktop or within WSL Arch Linux. That way I can test this website or other web based projects on my phone without having to actually publish them anywhere.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
