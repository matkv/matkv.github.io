While I enjoy tinkering to a certain extent, at some point it just started to feel like I was spending too much time to achieve things in Neovim that I would get out of the box with other editors (Debugging being one of the bigger examples). I understand that other&rsquo;s might have other usecases and needs and that Neovim might be a perfect fit for them, but I can now say that I&rsquo;ve given Neovim (and Emacs previously) an honest shot, but for an actual IDE, it is just not for me.</p><p>So I&rsquo;ve made the decision to give up on trying to use Neovim as my main IDE - I&rsquo;ll be going back to VSCode - but instead I&rsquo;m going to set it up to be just a fast & comfortable to use text editor, not specifically for writing code.</p><h3 id=things-i-loved-about-neovim>Things I loved about Neovim</h3><p>I&rsquo;m not going to stop using Neovim - there are a lot of things about it that I love and I&rsquo;m definitely planning to keep using.</p><ul><li>Speed - I don&rsquo;t think I need to explain that one</li><li>Keybindings - I&rsquo;ve gotten very used to the keybindings, I&rsquo;m using them in Obsidian, I&rsquo;m using them at work in Visual Studio with the VSVim extension and I&rsquo;m planning to try & set them up in VSCode as well</li><li>Customizabilty - I can change every little thing I want (this can however also lead to getting distracted and messing around with the editor instead of actually working)</li><li>Plugins - some plugins have really improved my workflow, for example there&rsquo;s an Obsidian plugin for Neovim that makes navigating a Obsidian vault really comfortable, or just small plugins like Zenmode that remove distractions when working on a single file + obviously the endless theming options in Neovim</li><li>Fuzzy finder & grep - probably the feature I miss the most in a lot of other editors, it&rsquo;s just so fast find files and navigate to them.</li><li>Leap.nvim - a very intuitive (at least for me) way to jump to any part in a file super quickly, basically removes any need to use the mouse and is something I keep doing by mistake in other editors because it just feels right</li><li>Lazy.nvim - very easy way to keep everything in Neovim up to date</li></ul><h3 id=what-i-want-to-use-neovim-for>What I want to use Neovim for</h3><ul><li><strong>not</strong> an IDE - I will be removing all the plugins and customization that were specific to getting some language working in Neovim</li><li>a fast and as minimal as possible text editor for day to day notes, especially in Obsidian</li><li>having clean and simple dotfiles and set it up as a long term text editor that will feel comfortable to use for years (so I need to really clean up my dotfiles for Neovim again)</li></ul><h3 id=what-i-want-to-use-vscode-for>What I want to use VSCode for</h3><ul><li>my main IDE - get a nice set up for my most used languages going again, including snippets, debugging and everything else I expect from a modern IDE</li><li>set up vim keybindings in VSCode - really put effort into making them work nicely (I need to check out several extentions and decide what I want to go for)</li><li>overall look into what extensions are popular these days and decide if they make sense for me</li><li>set up my dotfiles for VSCode again and maintain them</li></ul><br><div class=blogbacktolist><a href=/blog>« Back to overview</a></div></div><div class=footer><p>© 2023 | matkv</p></div></body></html>
