However I have been reading some other books on the side too. I have now decided to fully focus on the Wheel Of Time because I&rsquo;m actually just a third of the way done with the whole series :D</p><p>According to Wikipedia, it is the longest book of The Wheel Of Time series even though it has fewer pages than Lord of Chaos (393 823 words).</p><p>In this book the main characters are (once again) split up. Rand goes to the Aiel Waste to learn more about the Aiel and get accepted by them as the Dragon Reborn, Egwene and Moirane/Lan also join them because Egwene is trying to improve her abilities of Dreamwalking. Perrin returns to the Two Rivers to deal with the Whitecloaks & the Trollocs (with Faile & Loial) and Nynaeve & Elayne are dealing with the Black Ajah in Tear.</p><p>Overall I really enjoyed most of the storylines and felt that the pacing was better compared to the previous books. I still really like the relationships between Faile & Perrin and Nynaeve and Elayne & co, there was also a pretty wild storyline with Tar Valon & Siuan Sanche that is now continued in book 5 as I&rsquo;m reading it.</p><p>To summarise: really solid, I liked it & I&rsquo;m curious to see where to story will go next (Still haven&rsquo;t read any major spoilers so far :D)</p></div><div class=book-dateread>Finished: 25 July 2022</div><br><div class=separator><hr></div><br><div class=book-title>Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World</div><div class=book-details>Cal Newport (2019)</div><div class=book-rating>★★★☆☆</div><div class=book-review><p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to get my phone usage down & just be more mindful about my technology usage in general so I decided to read this book by Cal Newport.</p><p>Overall I liked it, at first he gave examples about other people who we commited to Digital Minimalism and talked about how, for example, social media companies are trying to gain & keep our attention for as long as possible.</p><p>The book also showed how several historical figures used their times alone to deal with the issues in their lives, such as Abraham Lincoln or Henry David Thoreau who decided to live alone in the woods for a while.</p><p>The main idea was that technology should:</p><ol><li>Serve something you deeply value (offering <em>some</em> benefit is not enough)</li><li>Be the <em>best</em> way to use technology to serve this value (if it&rsquo;s not, replace it with something better)</li><li>Have a role in your life that is constrained with a standard operating procedure that specifies <em>when</em> and <em>how</em> you use it.</li></ol><p>In the last part Cal Newport tries to give some advice on how to actually start <em>living</em> in a way that mirrors this mindset. I talked more about how I personally am going to try to achieve this in my <a href=https://matkv.dev/blog/on-digital-minimalism/>blog post</a>.</p><p>All in all, I liked the book but it also didn&rsquo;t contain some crazy life changing advice. I&rsquo;ll have to see how well I&rsquo;ll be able to embrace this mindset.</p></div><div class=book-dateread>Finished: 7 July 2022</div><br><div class=separator><hr></div><br><div class=book-title>The Midnight Library</div><div class=book-details>Matt Haig (2020)</div><div class=book-rating>★★★☆☆</div><div class=book-review><p>It took me quite a while to finish this book even though it&rsquo;s only around 300 pages long. I started it once early last year but actually gave up on it because the story just didn&rsquo;t click with me.
Gave it another shot this year but I still struggled with it in the beginning. I tried listening to the audiobook for a bit (narrated by Carey Mulligan, loved her narration) which helped to at least get far enough into the story to keep going & finish it.</p><p>The book tells the story of Nora Seed who, after a suicide attempt, ends up in &ldquo;The Midnight Library&rdquo;, a place between life and death. There she meets Mrs. Elm, a librarian that cared for her during her childhood. She gets to experience all the lives she could have lived if she took different decisions throughout her life by picking a book from the shelves of this library. We see how her decisions shaped the lives of the people around her in all those parralell lives & how experiencing all those lives shaped her attitude towards life in general.</p><p>Overall it was nice, not blown away by it but I did enjoy the ending & the writing style was also enjoyable. Definitely a bit predictable at times though, but all in all I enjoyed it.</p></div><div class=book-dateread>Finished: 12 June 2022</div><br><div class=separator><hr></div><br><div class=book-title>All Systems Red (The Murderbot Diaries, #1)</div><div class=book-details>Martha Wells (2017)</div><div class=book-rating>★★★★☆</div><div class=book-review><p>This book is written from the perspective of a
security bot (in a science fiction setting) which managed to
become independent. The book follows its thoughts now that it has to deal with social awkwardness, its pessimistic worldview and the human clients on
whose mission it has to protect them.</p><p>Murderbot has such a fun personality, constantly complaining about
not being able to spend its time watching entertainment shows and trying avoiding any interaction with humans.</p><p>Really cute concept & it&rsquo;s overall a lighthearted & very short book so it was easy to finish. I&rsquo;ll probably give the other books in the series a shot! Would definitely recommend it!</p></div><div class=book-dateread>Finished: 4 May 2022</div><br><div class=separator><hr></div><br><div class=book-title>Lessons in Stoicism: What Ancient Philosophers Teach Us about How to Live</div><div class=book-details>John Sellars (2019)</div><div class=book-rating>★★★★☆</div><div class=book-review><p>After reading &ldquo;Meditations&rdquo; by Marcus Aurelius I wanted to read another book on Stoicism. I found this one by John Sellars
to be super interesting.</p><p>It gives an overview and a basic introduction to the history & the main ideas in Stoicism, clears up some misconceptions that people might
have about this philosophy and then describes how the most important stoics came up with their ideas and how we can
apply them in our daily lives.</p><p>I&rsquo;d definitely recommend this book to anyone trying to learn more about Stoicism, I actually wish that I had read it
before starting with &ldquo;Meditations&rdquo;.</p></div><div class=book-dateread>Finished: 12 April 2022</div><br><div class=separator><hr></div><br><div class=paginationicons><span><a href=/reading/page/2/><i class="fa fa-greater-than"></i></a></span></div></div><div class=footer><p>© 2022 | matkv</p></div></body></html>
