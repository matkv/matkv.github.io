I found this one by John Sellars to be super interesting.
It gives an overview and a basic introduction to the history &amp;amp; the main ideas in Stoicism, clears up some misconceptions that people might have about this philosophy and then describes how the most important stoics came up with their ideas and how we can apply them in our daily lives.</description></item><item><title>Will-My-Cat-Eat-My-Eyeballs-Caitlin-Doughty</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/reading/will-my-cat-eat-my-eyeballs-caitlin-doughty/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Apr 2022 12:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/reading/will-my-cat-eat-my-eyeballs-caitlin-doughty/</guid><description>Another non-fiction book! Fairly short book by a mortician that answers weird questions asked by kids about death in a fun way. Despite the obviously pretty morbid &amp;amp; depressing topic the book is overall very light-hearted and fun.
There were definitely some very interesting bits of information in this book and I&amp;rsquo;d overall recommend it to anyone interested in this topic.</description></item><item><title>Project ideas for my Raspberry Pi</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/blog/project-ideas-for-my-raspberry-pi/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Mar 2022 20:46:26 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/blog/project-ideas-for-my-raspberry-pi/</guid><description>&lt;p>Now that my old Raspberry Pi isn&amp;rsquo;t used anymore as a 24/7 torrent box for my &amp;hellip; Linux ISOs, here are some ideas about what I could use for now.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mark active menu bold in Hugo</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/blog/mark-active-menu-bold-in-hugo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Mar 2022 21:46:26 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/blog/mark-active-menu-bold-in-hugo/</guid><description>&lt;p>A quick summary of how I managed to set the currently active menu item bold on this website.

Overall I thought it was okay, definitely a fairly slow read - not necessarily boring but the roughly 80-90 pages felt longer than they actually were.
The story is about an old man and his struggle while trying to catch &amp;amp; bring back home a big Marlin fish. It talks about his endurance, his stoicism and eventually the futility of his effort. I liked the parts that show his relationship with the boy that takes care of him.</description></item><item><title>The-Dragon-Reborn-The-Wheel-of-Time-3</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/reading/the-dragon-reborn-the-wheel-of-time-3-robert-jordan/</link><pubDate>Sat, 12 Mar 2022 12:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/reading/the-dragon-reborn-the-wheel-of-time-3-robert-jordan/</guid><description>Finally done with the third book in the Wheel Of Time series! This one actually took me quite a long time - I started reading it on November 7th of last year. Especially in the first second quarter of the book it got kind of slow in my opinion which made me take several breaks and read other short books in the meantime.
This is the first book so far that actually wasn&amp;rsquo;t focused primarily on Rand.</description></item><item><title>Current projects</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/blog/current-projects/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Mar 2022 20:50:26 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/blog/current-projects/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been struggling to find a programming side project that I am really passionate about. In the last couple of weeks my main two projects have been this

This book is a collection of questions mostly about space, the future and technology that Stephen Hawking answers in pretty short chapters. Some questions/answers give insight to his own experiences in his life, both about his work and his personal struggle with his disability, some are about his expectations about the future, for example the impact of the advancement of A.I on humanity.
I expected this book to be drier than it actually was - although some of his answers went into pretty heavy scientific topics, he still managed to explain them in an understandable and often very humorous way.</description></item><item><title>Reading page and archetype</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/blog/reading-page-and-archetype/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/blog/reading-page-and-archetype/</guid><description>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m exhausted but I managed to set up a page for my &lt;strong>book reviews / reading list&lt;/strong>!

It&amp;rsquo;s mostly just the thoughts and ramblings of a girl that is frustrated and looking for her purpose in life. I find it pretty hard to describe the book because there&amp;rsquo;s not really a storyline, the main character is just reflecting on her current situation and her life &amp;amp; goals in general.
The book is definitely unique but overall I wasn&amp;rsquo;t blown away a bit.</description></item><item><title>Schachnovelle</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/reading/schachnovelle-stefan-zweig/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Dec 2021 12:12:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/reading/schachnovelle-stefan-zweig/</guid><description>I read this novella pretty spontaneously because I had just really been in a &amp;ldquo;chess mood&amp;rdquo; for the last couple of days.
Overall it was surprising how much of a page turner it actually was and it was a nice to read a Austrian book for a change.
Then again - from an emotional point of view this book hardly touched me so I&amp;rsquo;m giving it 3.5 stars I think. Worth a read but nothing exceptional in my opinion.</description></item><item><title>Starting my Rust journey</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/blog/starting-my-rust-journey/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 18:15:26 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/blog/starting-my-rust-journey/</guid><description>&lt;p>After struggling to find ideas for side projects &amp;amp; not really being motivated about any of my current pet projects I have decided to try learning &lt;strong>Rust&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Trying Doom Emacs</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/blog/trying-doom-emacs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 20:37:26 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/blog/trying-doom-emacs/</guid><description>&lt;p>After trying out NeoVim and LunarVim, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to also give Doom Emacs a try.

I did take a break of a week or two while I read some different books but overall I like that I got to know the characters even more now and the story is really starting to pick up. I especially enjoyed some of the new friendships that were formed in this one.
I don&amp;rsquo;t have any big criticism when it comes to the pacing, I think it was definitely better than the first one.</description></item><item><title>Custom blog type</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/blog/custom-blog-type/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Nov 2021 20:46:26 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/blog/custom-blog-type/</guid><description>&lt;p>There is a &lt;strong>custom blog type&lt;/strong> for this website now - this means it is possible to create a blog post with just one command.

Loved the writing, obviously an incredibly heavy topic but the descriptions of his time as resident in the hospital and his motivations &amp;amp; reasons to become a doctor in the first place were very insightful.</description></item><item><title>Custom project type</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/blog/custom-project-type/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 23:15:55 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/blog/custom-project-type/</guid><description>&lt;p>I just finally finished creating a custom type for projects.

My main thoughts: super pretty and flowery writing style - sometimes hard to read for me as a non native English speaker (then again neither was Nabokov).
My main problem with the book wasn&amp;rsquo;t even the obviously problematic/disturbing relationship between the two main characters but mostly that I just didn&amp;rsquo;t really care for the story at some point. I actually took a break of several months before finally finishing this book.</description></item><item><title>Man's-Search-for-Meaning</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/reading/mans-search-for-meaning-viktor-e.-frankl/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Sep 2021 12:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/reading/mans-search-for-meaning-viktor-e.-frankl/</guid><description>The first part of the book describes the experiences of the author during his imprisonment in several concentration camps and talks about dealing with the situation there and finding a reason to accept &amp;amp; continue enduring his suffering there. Obviously some very disturbing &amp;amp; tragic description of events there.
The second part was about his general philosophy called Logotherapy. This was definitely more dry, but I liked that for every statement or idea he usually gave several examples of actual cases that prove and explain that idea in a more practical sense.</description></item><item><title>Meditations</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/reading/meditations-marcus-aurelius/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Sep 2021 12:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/reading/meditations-marcus-aurelius/</guid><description>This is my first introduction to stoicism and actually the first book on philosophy in general that I read. I read the Gregory Hayes translation which helped a lot - I first tried an older translation that was unecessarily difficult to understand when you&amp;rsquo;re used to modern English.
I found many of the ideas in the book quite interesting and insightful even though I don&amp;rsquo;t agree with all of them. At times the book was quite dry &amp;amp; repetitive but I guess that is to be expected when talking about this topic.</description></item><item><title>Cunk-on-Everything-The-Encyclopedia-Philomena</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/reading/cunk-on-everything-the-encyclopedia-philomena-jason-hazeley/</link><pubDate>Sun, 29 Aug 2021 12:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/reading/cunk-on-everything-the-encyclopedia-philomena-jason-hazeley/</guid><description>Funny concept but overall it wasn&amp;rsquo;t really my type of humor.

The beginning was definitely a bit slow but soon the story really picks up and the characters are driven by danger and urgency.
The characters are relatable and while they do fit some stereotypes as far as fantasy books are concerned, I did not find this to be detrimental to the story.</description></item><item><title>The-Last-Question</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/reading/the-last-question-isaac-asimov/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 May 2021 12:05:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/reading/the-last-question-isaac-asimov/</guid><description>Really cool short story with a suprising twist at the end.

The writing style is simple but the story just feels so cozy and comfy to read. Of course it&amp;rsquo;s a book for children but it does a great job being that and is obviously a great entry point for someone trying to get into fantasy!</description></item><item><title>Let-the-Right-One-In</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/reading/let-the-right-one-in-john-ajvide-lindqvist/</link><pubDate>Tue, 29 Sep 2020 12:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/reading/let-the-right-one-in-john-ajvide-lindqvist/</guid><description>Really cool idea, loved the relationsship between Oskar and Eli. The general vibe and feeling in the book was definitely quite creepy. What I didn&amp;rsquo;t love is that some side storylines felt kind of ill-fitting to the rest of the story and especially the flashbacks of Eli felt kind of out of place and weren&amp;rsquo;t fleshed out enough. Overall I liked it but I feel like it could have been better.</description></item><item><title>The-Last-Wish-The-Witcher-05</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/reading/the-last-wish-the-witcher-05-andrzej-sapkowski/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Aug 2020 12:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/reading/the-last-wish-the-witcher-05-andrzej-sapkowski/</guid><description>Went into this one with really high expectations but while I overall enjoyed it, the fact that it consists of several more or less separate stories rather than one cohesive story was kind of off putting.
I wanted to learn more about the Witcher universe before playing the game or watching the show but after finishing this one I just didn&amp;rsquo;t really feel the itch to continue with the series. I might give it another shot though at some point!</description></item><item><title>Bad-Blood-Secrets-and-Lies-in-a-Silicon-Valley-Startup</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/reading/bad-blood-secrets-and-lies-in-a-silicon-valley-startup-john-carreyrou/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 Aug 2020 12:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/reading/bad-blood-secrets-and-lies-in-a-silicon-valley-startup-john-carreyrou/</guid><description>Loved it! I actually had never heard of the whole scandal with Theranos but this book was a real page turner and gave me pretty good information about the whole thing. Even though it is non-fiction the story still felt like a &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; book and I found it very easy to follow. The author seems to have researched the topic really well and gave great insights on everything that happened.</description></item><item><title>The-Ocean-at-the-End-of-the-Lane</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/reading/the-ocean-at-the-end-of-the-lane-neil-gaiman/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jul 2020 12:07:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/reading/the-ocean-at-the-end-of-the-lane-neil-gaiman/</guid><description>My first book by Neil Gaiman. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why, but I just didn&amp;rsquo;t completely vibe with this book. Definitely had some pretty creative ideas and the writing style was pretty but I just didn&amp;rsquo;t find the story to be very engaging.</description></item><item><title>The-Institute</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/reading/the-institute-stephen-king/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2020 12:07:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/reading/the-institute-stephen-king/</guid><description>My first book by Stephen King. This book was definitely a page turner. It has a unique setting and I really liked the characters and the relationships they built. The ending wasn&amp;rsquo;t really strong but it seems like that&amp;rsquo;s pretty common with Stephen King&amp;rsquo;s books.</description></item><item><title>Hello-World-Being-Human-in-the-Age-of-Algorithms</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/reading/hello-world-being-human-in-the-age-of-algorithms-hannah-fry/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2020 12:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/reading/hello-world-being-human-in-the-age-of-algorithms-hannah-fry/</guid><description>Really interesting topic, the writing style was fine too. However it doesn&amp;rsquo;t really go into detail or a lot of depth about the specific examples in the book. Overall I enjoyed it, would definitely recommend it to someone who is into IT in general.</description></item><item><title>The-Perks-of-Being-a-Wallflower</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/reading/the-perks-of-being-a-wallflower-stephen-chbosky/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Apr 2020 12:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/reading/the-perks-of-being-a-wallflower-stephen-chbosky/</guid><description>Re-read this book in 2020 after reading it like 5-7 years ago. I actually remembered it to be way better than I found it now. Reading it now left me kind of underwhelmed. Overall it is a pretty nice read though and definitely has emotional moments.
This book is actually one of the rare cases where I vastly prefer the movie.</description></item><item><title>The-Hitchhiker's-Guide-to-the-Galaxy-Hitchhiker's-Guide-to-the-Galaxy-1</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/reading/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy-1-douglas-adams/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2020 12:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/reading/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy-hitchhikers-guide-to-the-galaxy-1-douglas-adams/</guid><description>Actually had really high expectations for this book but I was overall a bit dissapointed. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s just not my style of humor but I probably won&amp;rsquo;t be continuing this series. I guess it&amp;rsquo;s nice to now have some info on some references in pop-culture but overall it just didn&amp;rsquo;t really blow me away.</description></item><item><title>Animal-Farm</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/reading/animal-farm-george-orwell/</link><pubDate>Sat, 18 Apr 2020 12:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/reading/animal-farm-george-orwell/</guid><description>I get the overall message, but I just found it way too predictable and just like with 1984 I just don&amp;rsquo;t really love Orwell&amp;rsquo;s writing style. All in all I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth the read though, even if it&amp;rsquo;s just for the references in popular culture and general idea and political allegory.
If it hadn&amp;rsquo;t been such a super short read I would have probably quit reading it.</description></item><item><title>Oathbringer-The-Stormlight-Archive-3</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/reading/oathbringer-the-stormlight-archive-3-brandon-sanderson/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Apr 2020 12:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/reading/oathbringer-the-stormlight-archive-3-brandon-sanderson/</guid><description>Fantastic just like the other ones in the series.

Incredible worldbuilding, amazing characters and story - an absolute page turner.

It portraits the naivety with which these young men went to war, looking at it as some sort of adventure which then turned into bleakness. The writing style definitely felt dated but then again this book was written fairly shortly after the war. Would absolutely recommend it, probably one of best (anti) war books I&amp;rsquo;ve read.</description></item><item><title>The-Whisperer-in-Darkness</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/reading/the-whisperer-in-darkness-h.p.-lovecraft/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Oct 2019 12:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/reading/the-whisperer-in-darkness-h.p.-lovecraft/</guid><description>The book is structured as a series of letters describing some supernatural events happening. Some pretty creepy parts but overall I found the writing style a bit too dry. It was also my first Lovecraft book so I think some references to his &amp;ldquo;universe&amp;rdquo; went over my head. Overall it was pretty nice though.</description></item><item><title>What-If-Serious-Scientific-Answers-to-Absurd-Hypothetical-Questions-What-If-1</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/reading/what-if-serious-scientific-answers-to-absurd-hypothetical-questions-what-if-1-randall-munroe/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2019 12:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/reading/what-if-serious-scientific-answers-to-absurd-hypothetical-questions-what-if-1-randall-munroe/</guid><description>Really fun book! If you enjoy the xkcd comics, you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy this book too. Each chapter answers some silly question in a pretty scientific way. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to just pick it up every now and then because each chapter can basically stand on its own.</description></item><item><title>Permanent-Record</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/reading/permanent-record-edward-snowden/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Oct 2019 12:10:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/reading/permanent-record-edward-snowden/</guid><description>Absolutely loved it. Really great insights in both his personal and professional life, from his beginnings all the way to his whistle-blowing. I&amp;rsquo;m generally interested in IT &amp;amp; privacy concerning this topic so I found this to be a great read.
The writing style is very easy to follow and the book was a page turner. Definitely recommend it!</description></item><item><title>Sapiens-A-Brief-History-of-Humankind</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/reading/sapiens-a-brief-history-of-humankind-yuval-noah-harari/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2019 12:09:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/reading/sapiens-a-brief-history-of-humankind-yuval-noah-harari/</guid><description>Did not love it. During several times in the book the author seems to present his own opinions as facts without really backing them up with any sources. Overall it was interesting though and I did learn some new things.</description></item><item><title>Night--The-Night-Trilogy-1</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/reading/night--the-night-trilogy-1-elie-wiesel/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Aug 2019 12:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/reading/night--the-night-trilogy-1-elie-wiesel/</guid><description>The book definitely portraits the horrible things happening during the holocaust well but for some reason I just didn&amp;rsquo;t really find the writing style very immersive. I liked it as far as the story is concerned but from a literary point of view I did not really enjoy reading it.</description></item><item><title>East-of-Eden</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/reading/east-of-eden-john-steinbeck/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Aug 2019 12:08:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/reading/east-of-eden-john-steinbeck/</guid><description>Really great prose, definitely felt old-timey quite often but I guess that&amp;rsquo;s to be expected from a book that was written a while ago. Very descriptive writing at times and not the biggest page-turner but I liked it a lot overall.
I might give it a re-read at some point.</description></item><item><title>A-Monster-Calls</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/reading/a-monster-calls-patrick-ness/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Jul 2019 12:07:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/reading/a-monster-calls-patrick-ness/</guid><description>Liked it a lot. A pretty quick read, very unique story. The writing style was pretty and I liked the little stories within the main story that the reader is shown.</description></item><item><title>Norwegian-Wood</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/reading/norwegian-wood-haruki-murakami/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jun 2019 12:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/reading/norwegian-wood-haruki-murakami/</guid><description>Really unique writing style, the story itself wasn&amp;rsquo;t actually a big part of the book. I felt like the relationships between the characters were the main focus. Definitely felt quite relatable at times.
One thing I found off-putting was the overly sexual themes at times. Seems like the main character has a sexual relationship with pretty much every other female character he interacts with. Kind of felt forced/unfitting more often than not.</description></item><item><title>The-Book-Thief</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/reading/the-book-thief-markus-zusak/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Jun 2019 12:06:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/reading/the-book-thief-markus-zusak/</guid><description>Really liked it overall. It was unique to have death as the narrator, the relationships between the characters felt very believable and the writing style was beautiful.</description></item><item><title>Never-Let-Me-Go</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/reading/never-let-me-go-kazuo-ishiguro/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 May 2019 12:05:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/reading/never-let-me-go-kazuo-ishiguro/</guid><description>Overall a really unique and interesting story and a fine writing style - but I just could never really build a connection to the characters and feel very invested into their life. To me the book and the ending were just okay - not bad but not amazing either.</description></item><item><title>Flowers-for-Algernon</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/reading/flowers-for-algernon-daniel-keyes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 May 2019 12:05:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/reading/flowers-for-algernon-daniel-keyes/</guid><description>Loved the way the writing style changes simultaneously with the mental state of the main character while the story progresses, first time I read something like that. In general the ending was kind of spoiled or at least too predictable by the synopsis and general descriptions of the book.
It didn&amp;rsquo;t have the deep emotional impact on me as it seems to have on a lot of readers but I would overall still absolutely recommend it.</description></item><item><title>All-the-Light-We-Cannot-See</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/reading/all-the-light-we-cannot-see-anthony-doerr/</link><pubDate>Sun, 05 May 2019 12:05:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/reading/all-the-light-we-cannot-see-anthony-doerr/</guid><description>Loved the writing style and the way the story switches between the two different viewpoints of the main characters. I definitely remember thinking that the prose was really beautiful.
Only negative point for me personally was the ending, I felt like it would have been better if the book had ended a bit earlier, the last part felt kind of tacked on and didn&amp;rsquo;t really fit with the feel of the rest of the book.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://matkv.github.io/start/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/start/</guid><description/></item><item><title>about</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/about/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m Matko, a 27 year old software developer from Austria.
