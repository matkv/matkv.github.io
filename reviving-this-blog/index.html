I&rsquo;m trying to change that now, so here are some ideas on what direction I want to take this blog in the future and what kind of content I want to focus on.</p><p>So far this blog has been mostly (with some smaller exceptions) been focused on tech & programming related content.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve decided that I am going to try to write about a <strong>wider range of topics</strong> - especially when considering that in the last couple of months - due to not having a project I&rsquo;m really interested in - I haven&rsquo;t been writing a lot of code in my free time anyway so that&rsquo;s not where my focus currently is. And I also just want to make it a habit to write more in general, especially longer posts and stay consistent with it.</p><p>Some ideas for future content are:</p><ul><li>habits / self improvement</li><li>movie reviews</li><li>literature (apart from my book reviews)</li><li>fitness</li><li>just general writing practice</li><li>music production & guitar/piano stuff</li></ul><p>Overall I just don&rsquo;t want to feel limited about what I&rsquo;m putting on here - I will however most likely go through some of the stuff I&rsquo;ve already posted here (especially things like notes) and decide if I still really need that on this website instead of just moving them over to my Obsidian vault where I keep pretty much everything else that is text-based but not actual code.</p><p>I have quite a lot of different interests & hobbies and this blog could be a nice way of sharing what I&rsquo;m currently interested in.</p><p>There are also some areas on this website that need general improvement or just a bit of tinkering. I need to add some book reviews for books I&rsquo;ve read since the middle of last year & I&rsquo;ve been also thinking of maybe trying out some sort of <em>log</em> where I post small updates of what I&rsquo;m up to every now and then. Maybe this could replace the &ldquo;now&rdquo; page that I&rsquo;m currently using.</p><p>I&rsquo;ve been looking at a lot of the blogs/websites from <a href=https://webring.xxiivv.com/>this</a> webring and have been getting a lot of inspiration for stuff I might want to add to this site. Since I don&rsquo;t have any other real programming pet projects (other than continuing learning Rust occasionally), at least I can improve some stuff on here - hopefully somewhat regularly.</p><p>This is a random thought, but I&rsquo;ve also decided to try to <strong>keep my GitHub commits low on weekends</strong> - or at least try to avoid doing too much on the computer on weekends and if I still do something - I want to at least try focusing on non-software dev related topics. At least on weekends. I&rsquo;m already looking at a screen for 8+ hours a day at work & pretty much every weekday evening as well. So maybe restricting myself (when it comes to programming) to only Monday to Friday could be an option.</p><p>Obviously this is not a hard rule - just a general intention.</p><p>So yeah, I&rsquo;m basically just rambling now but I&rsquo;ll try to actually stick to updating this blog more regularly!</p></main><footer><div class=footer><div class=construction>This site is still a work in progress, some content might be missing or incomplete & the styling might look
