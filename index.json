Initially I was kind of turned off by the fact that it\u0026rsquo;s based on GTK when running it on Linux so it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really look native on KDE.\nBut in the meantime they at least changed the titlebar to look nice on QT (KDE), and since I\u0026rsquo;m not really using the tab functionality directly in Ghostty since i use Zellij for that, it actually does everything I need it to do. I don\u0026rsquo;t really see any killer feature yet that would differentiate it from WezTerm for my personal usecase - but then again I\u0026rsquo;m not really using any advanced features in WezTerm either.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s possible that there\u0026rsquo;s some small issue with the column length for fastfetch, haven\u0026rsquo;t really checked that yet.\nGitHub Copilot CLI Another tool that I just started playing around with is GitHub Copilot CLI. I\u0026rsquo;ve already been using GitHub Copilot in VS Code and Visual Studio for like a year now, both with a personal subscription and at work, but this allows you to run it directly in the terminal.\nIt asks for permission to run any commands and you can set which working directories it has access to. It\u0026rsquo;s been pretty cool to just have it do some annoying or tedious tasks without needing to interact with it a lot. And since in most projects i track everything with Git anyways I\u0026rsquo;m not too worried about messing something up without being able to revert any changes.\nJust earlier today I had it create a PWA for TeuxDeux on KDE even though Firefox doesn\u0026rsquo;t officially support it yet on Linux. It has been pretty cool to see it actually try and look up things like the icon for it online and it tried out a couple KDE specific commands to have the app show up in the application menu. Pretty impressive - I probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have bothered to make it work myself.\nOverall I want to play around with it more but it seems like this opens up the usecases for Copilot quite a bit more for me.\n","title":"Trying Out Ghostty \u0026 Github Copilot CLI","url":"/trying-out-ghostty-github-copilot-cli/"},{"content":"","title":"Log","url":"/log/"},{"content":"","title":"Knowledge Management","url":"/tags/knowledge-management/"},{"content":"","title":"Obsidian","url":"/tags/obsidian/"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve now been using Obsidian for more than 3 years and during that time I\u0026rsquo;ve been building on top of the same vault as the one that I created initially when trying it out.\nNow that Obsidian finally introduced Bases - basically a way to view notes as a \u0026ldquo;database\u0026rdquo; that using the yaml properties inside each note - I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to give my whole setup a long overdue overhaul and re-think how I want to structure my vault.\nThis post is supposed to explain my ideas for this re-structuring and should be a guide \u0026amp; to-do for myself while working on this.\nGeneral changes changing the file naming scheme from titles like \u0026ldquo;obsidian-restructuring\u0026rdquo; to more normal filenames like \u0026ldquo;Obsidian Restructuring\u0026rdquo; having a more simplified main folder structure - I\u0026rsquo;m trying to use only a limited amount of folders \u0026amp; sub-folders while still having enough of them to keep my notes organized. Instead of relying on folders, I\u0026rsquo;m trying to use tags more (I\u0026rsquo;ve previously not used them at all) to add a note to multiple \u0026ldquo;topics\u0026rdquo; at once a more simplified default template, just consisting of \u0026ldquo;description\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;tags\u0026rdquo; fields \u0026amp; separate templates for my books base and the posts for this site Main folder structure Archive - no longer relevant notes Database - the files for my bases \u0026amp; index pages Inbox - a place to capture new notes before moving them to the correct spot \u0026amp; my \u0026ldquo;Notepad\u0026rdquo; scratchpad file Journal - my weekly journal files Notes - the \u0026ldquo;main\u0026rdquo; notes folder, most of the content is in here matkv.dev - blog posts for this website Obsidian Attachments Templates Web Clipper Templates Bases Instead of relying on folders, I\u0026rsquo;m using bases to group my notes together and display lists / MOCs of them. I then just have a file called \u0026ldquo;Home\u0026rdquo; in which I\u0026rsquo;m showing different views of all my bases. But this is generated automatically so I don\u0026rsquo;t have to manually link or edit anything.\nI have already set up a couple of bases:\nArchive Books This contains my \u0026ldquo;To-Read\u0026rdquo; list and already finished book reviews The base is created just by filtering for the \u0026ldquo;Database/Index/Books\u0026rdquo; folder - that\u0026rsquo;s where the actual files for each books are. In order to still have them connected in the Obsidian graph, the default book template has an \u0026ldquo;Index\u0026rdquo; property which just links to an index file in the same folder as the books base. So this way I don\u0026rsquo;t have to manually remember linking the note - it happens automatically when creating any book note. In the \u0026ldquo;Home\u0026rdquo; file I then have one view that filters the base to only show books with the status \u0026ldquo;To-Read\u0026rdquo; and one that shows the ones with the status \u0026ldquo;Finished\u0026rdquo; Gaming This just shows all notes with the \u0026ldquo;#gaming\u0026rdquo; tag, no filtering based on folders Generally this just means that I have one note per game that I\u0026rsquo;m currently playing Inbox All notes in the \u0026ldquo;Inbox\u0026rdquo; folder matkv.dev All notes for this website, also just filtered for a specific directory and I also have an index file for this so the graph looks nicer Notes My \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; notes - if a note is not in any of the categories above, it\u0026rsquo;s just a normal note that can be anywhere and linked to any other note. This is basically the main type of notes in my vault Web Clippings Any note captured with the Obsidian Web Clipper lands here Obsidian web clipper I finally set up the web clipper extension and it is actually working really nicely with the bases. For now, I have two templates for the web clipper. One let\u0026rsquo;s me add books to my \u0026ldquo;To-Read\u0026rdquo; list in the books base with just one click. I just need to open any book on Goodreads \u0026amp; click on the web clipper icon - it automatically figures out I\u0026rsquo;m on Goodreads and picks the correct template and fills out some basic info that it \u0026ldquo;scrapes\u0026rdquo; from the web page. The note is placed in the correct folder and the index is set correctly.\nThis makes it very quick to add new books to the vault. I\u0026rsquo;m planning to probably set up the same for IMDB to quickly add movies to my watchlist.\nFor normal clippings it selects the basic web clipper template and I usually edit it directly a bit before adding it to the vault.\nOverall this looks promising, the extension also works on Firefox mobile so I can use it on my phone - even though I wish it would be maybe possible to directly share a website to the Obsidian app and it would behave the same way as the clipper.\nVibe coded helper app Considering I have to go through around 500 files in my old vault, I decided to try \u0026ldquo;vibe-coding\u0026rdquo; a little helper app to keep track of everything. I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to build anything myself since this would really be a one-time thing. This could have probably just been an Excel file but I think it was better to spend two hours arguing with GitHub Copilot to build a little Go web app :)\nThis is what it looks like:\nThis was actually the first time I tried to build something without writing a single line of code - worked out relatively well and it\u0026rsquo;s good enough for a one-time project.\n","title":"Obsidian Restructuring","url":"/obsidian-restructuring/"},{"content":"My book reviews.

This means I finally am also able to play around with writing some classical stuff since Ableton doesn\u0026rsquo;t offer a lot there out of the box.\nThe Grandeur Piano A piano VST - I\u0026rsquo;m actually suprised how nice it sounds and it\u0026rsquo;s definitely an upgrade over the built in pianos in Ableton. Also has a bunch of nice presets and the common things like pedal noise and different rooms for reverb. You can even open or close the lid of the piano which affects the sound.

I installed Ollama locally on Windows and then downloaded two models just to play around with them: Deepseek R1 \u0026amp; LLama 2 Uncensored.\nI wrote a little tutorial for myself that lets me download Ollama \u0026amp; the models to a different drive than the default location because they take up quite a bit of storage space. I also think it\u0026rsquo;s wild that you basically need as much free RAM as the size of the model in order to run it. So for the models with huge amounts of parameters you need some pretty insane setups.\nOverall I think it\u0026rsquo;s pretty cool that you can run an LLM completely locally - basically without any restrictions on how often you can ask a question (in comparison to chatGPT for example), and also with faster response times - the LLama 2 model responds pretty much instantaneously for me. The Deepseek model seems to show it\u0026rsquo;s thinking process in greyed out text for quite a while before actually answering. So this could be a cool way to still have a local copilot even when I don\u0026rsquo;t have internet access. Fun to mess around with it in any case.\nI read that these local models are supposed to be a bit less restricted \u0026amp; uncensored in comparison to the online models but from playing around with it that hasn\u0026rsquo;t really been the case for me. Maybe I need to try other models for that.\nMaybe I\u0026rsquo;ll have an idea for a usecase for a local LLM in a software project, can\u0026rsquo;t think of anything specific yet though.\n","title":"Trying out local LLMs","url":"/trying-out-local-llms/"},{"content":"I created a personal wiki using Quartz.\nI\u0026rsquo;m currently still in the process of setting everything up and learning how to use it.

I bought the Standard version of Ableton Live and I\u0026rsquo;m really motivated to get back into this hobby and actually learn it from the ground up again.\nAs mentioned, I definitely already have some experience with digital music production - I used to have a once a week course in music school back when I was still taking piano lessons but this is now more than a decade ago (Oh god, I\u0026rsquo;m getting old). Additionally I played around with some DAWs (Cubase and an older version of Ableton, and for a short time FL Studio) but I never took the time to actually learn any of those tools.\nI started playing piano/keyboard when I was 8, and guitar when I was around 18 - I\u0026rsquo;m now 29 - and in all this time I never actually wrote or recorded a single piece of music. I definitely played around with some ideas but I never worked on them enough to turn them into a real song.\nBut over the last couple of years I actually got some of the hardware that would enable me to do this more comfortably and now that I own a \u0026ldquo;real\u0026rdquo; DAW, there\u0026rsquo;s nothing really stopping me. And I\u0026rsquo;m overall pretty motivated to get into this hobby more - both because I felt that recently I\u0026rsquo;ve kind of neglected my instrument practice and this would definitely help with that, and also because it just seems like a hobby where you also get to learn a worthwhile skill alongside it.\nInitially I think I\u0026rsquo;ll just pick some tutorials from YouTube and follow them to refresh the basics of Ableton Live again. Overall I\u0026rsquo;m actually pretty excited to try all of this out.

However when it comes to actually doing those challenges every day, I just get to a point where I really lose the motivation to stick to it.

So when I\u0026rsquo;m done with work for the day, I\u0026rsquo;m often struggling to find the energy to work on something software related in the evening as well.\nAnother reason is that while these tasks are overall quite short and focused on one specific topic, they can actually get quite complicated when it comes to catching all the edge cases (especially in part 2 of most tasks). So I often ask myself if it is worth using my free time to solve these problems instead of at least working on an actual pet project that I\u0026rsquo;ll continue working on for a longer time.\nI have to admit that it\u0026rsquo;s mostly laziness \u0026amp; a lack of energy.\nHowever, it turns out that I\u0026rsquo;m substantially worse in Go than I thought lol - initially didn\u0026rsquo;t want to do the exercises in a language that I knew better, like C# for example.

Go does some stuff quite differently than I\u0026rsquo;m used to (I can\u0026rsquo;t modify a string in a for loop, really?), so I struggled with topics that would be a no-brainer in C#.\nSo I definitely need more practice with Go \u0026amp; I\u0026rsquo;m probably quitting Advent of Code for this year at least.\n","title":"Advent of Code \u0026 laziness","url":"/advent-of-code-and-laziness/"},{"content":"","title":"Aoc","url":"/tags/aoc/"},{"content":"","title":"Code","url":"/tags/code/"},{"content":"","title":"Programming","url":"/tags/programming/"},{"content":"So, I think I\u0026rsquo;ve finally managed to get a working setup for Neovim keybindings in VSCode going. In fact, I\u0026rsquo;m not only using the Neovim keybindings - I\u0026rsquo;m actually running Neovim inside VSCode.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve been checking out this Neovim plugin for VSCode. Here Neovim is used for the actual code editing but you still have a normal Visual Studio Code experience. After a bit of tinkering - it seems that I now have a setup with which I can actually be productive while getting the best of both worlds.\nFor Neovim, I\u0026rsquo;m using LazyVim and its developer folke just recently put out an additional feature called extras, which also includes one for VSCode. This basically disables all the existing plugins except for some very basic ones that are useful for purely text editing and wouldn\u0026rsquo;t mess things up when using Neovim inside VSCode. It also sets some useful keybindings that make using VSCode feel more like Neovim.\nSo now I basically didn\u0026rsquo;t have to mess up my existing Neovim config at all, just needed to enable this extra and pretty much everything seems to work out of the box.\nall the usual vim keybindings work out of the box my personal keybindings from Neovim are now available when editing text in VSCode the plugin that let\u0026rsquo;s me jump around in a file comfortable (leap or flash, idk which one is used in the extra exactly), works out of the box which has been a big pain point when using VSCode without it (the color highlighting is still a bit weird but I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;ll find a way to fix it, it\u0026rsquo;s not a dealbreaker for now) the common vim commands are autofilled and shown in a little dialog withing VSCode SPC + SPC opens a fuzzy file picker (even though it can\u0026rsquo;t beat the speed of the file picker in Neovim) This means I don\u0026rsquo;t need to unlearn/relearn any muscle memory when jumping between Neovim and VSCode + I get the benefit of having a easy and mostly automatic setup of debugging and testing for basically any language I want to use. I tried it out for a bit in a Go project and it all just seems to work. I\u0026rsquo;ll play around in a C# project too and see if everything seems fine there too.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll eventually still go through all the settings in the VSCode plugin once again and check if I can improve some stuff but for now it seems like I\u0026rsquo;ve finally managed to find a setup that let\u0026rsquo;s me work comfortably. Super happy about that.\nMaybe this means I\u0026rsquo;ll finally start working on actual projects again instead of fucking around with my editors all the time. Haha.\n","title":"My Neovim in VSCode setup","url":"/vscode-neovim-setup/"},{"content":"","title":"Neovim","url":"/tags/neovim/"},{"content":"A quick overview of what I\u0026rsquo;m using as my personal knowledge base and to-do list.\nLast year in may I wrote about Obsidian as my personal knowledge base. I\u0026rsquo;ve actually been using it ever since and it\u0026rsquo;s become a really nice tool to keep track of basically everything text based in my life that is not specifically source code.\nAdditionally I\u0026rsquo;ve also been looking for (and found) a better way to handle my to-do list and general tasks. I went from using just pen \u0026amp; paper in a little notebook, to using Google Tasks, to now finally settling on TeuxDeux.\nAnd just this week I\u0026rsquo;ve been looking into a better way to save articles for reading them later and I\u0026rsquo;ve stumbled upon Omnivore.\nObsidian Obsidian has become one of my most used pieces of software these days. I\u0026rsquo;ve moved basically any type of text-based documents into my Obsidian vault. A week or two ago I finally made the leap to buy Obsidian Sync - and I don\u0026rsquo;t regret it so far (even though the price can be considered a bit steep at roughly 8$ per month when buying the yearly subscription).\nBut now that I am able to comfortably use it on my phone too I\u0026rsquo;ve been getting even more into it. I\u0026rsquo;m currently looking into more ways to improve my workflow in Obsidian and checking out some additional plugins - but the main selling point for me is just having a comfortable way to manage all of my notes in one place and not necessarily needing to worry about subfolders and where I\u0026rsquo;m putting my notes exactly. I can just create them and link them by topic instead.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also endless ways to customize it, I can use templates (for example for book reviews, journal entries, blog posts for this website) and it\u0026rsquo;s overall also just a great markdown editor.\nMy main uses for Obsidian are:\nday to day notes -\u0026gt; I just have a \u0026ldquo;notepad\u0026rdquo; file where I jot down what\u0026rsquo;s going on, things I want to remember, basically anything that crosses my mind and I want to record journal -\u0026gt; I\u0026rsquo;ve been trying to get back into journaling regularly, decided to go the digital route now so Obsidian has been very comfortable, especially now that I can create journal entries on my phone too. Currently I just have one note per week and notes for each month \u0026amp; year. A separate note for each day just got too messy and felt like overkill because most days I don\u0026rsquo;t write a whole lot anyways book reviews -\u0026gt; I have a template for book reviews that I use for this website and I also copy the content of them into Goodreads usually programming notes -\u0026gt; I usually take notes when learning a new programming language And of course just basically any other topic I can think o - if it\u0026rsquo;s text based, it goes into Obsidian.\nTeuxDeux As I said, for a while I moved all of my notes \u0026amp; to-do list to an actual paper notebook. I loved the aspect of just writing down all the things I want to get done today and be able to tick them off. However there were always two big downsides to doing this the analog way:\nhaving to manually move tasks from one day to the next difficult to track appointments and tasks for specific dates across multiple pages TeuxDeux basically solved this problem completely for me. It is genuinely pretty much perfect for the way I\u0026rsquo;d like to handle my to-do list.\nExcuse the pretty heavy censoring - but I don\u0026rsquo;t want to share all my tasks on it publicly :D But TeuxDeux has been such a great tool over the recent months. I love the way the layout works: you have your calendar view at the top, and at the bottom you have custom lists. So for each day I can drag and drop the tasks I want to tackle this day and any tasks that are left over at the end of the day are automatically moved to the next one.\nIt might look pretty minimal \u0026amp; simple, but that\u0026rsquo;s pretty much why I prefer it over other to-do apps. The only thing that it\u0026rsquo;s missing in my opinion would be the option to actually get reminders \u0026amp; notification for tasks - but generally the calendar view makes up for it because I can see upcoming tasks at least a couple days in advance. And long term appointments go into my calendar anyways, not my to-do list.\nYou can format the tasks with some markdown options, you can create subheaders and create repeating tasks. Overall this feels closest to what I would be doing with pen and paper - but without any of the downsides.\nI\u0026rsquo;m working with several categories so I can handle the majority of what I have to do just by looking at this first screen - but you could create a lot more sub-pages and you even have tabs at the bottom that let you organise these lists in more detail. I have lists for general tasks that don\u0026rsquo;t have a specific date, one list for my habits (mostly just to keep them in mind - these don\u0026rsquo;t really get ticked off), one for shopping lists (groceries and long-term \u0026ldquo;wish lists\u0026rdquo;), one for media in general (books, movies/tv, games - basically any kind of tasks concerning these topics) and one for general ideas and low priority tasks.\nAnd on the other two tabs I have one group of task-lists for software development in general (projects I\u0026rsquo;m working on, ideas, changes to my setup), and for now I have another list for things I want to change and improve in Obsidian. It\u0026rsquo;s just really nice to be able to separate different types of tasks so I don\u0026rsquo;t get overwhelmed and lose track of what\u0026rsquo;s important.\nGenerally I\u0026rsquo;m managing and organising the tasks mostly on the web app, and the mobile app is just for actually ticking off tasks during the day.\nI absolutely love TeuxDeux - the web app is actually not free, there\u0026rsquo;s a yearly subscription but considering how much I\u0026rsquo;m using this every day it is absolutely worth it for me.\nOmnivore This is actually a tool that I\u0026rsquo;ve just started using recently. For a while I\u0026rsquo;ve been using Pocket by Firefox as my \u0026ldquo;save for reading later\u0026rdquo; app - but a week or two ago I stumbled across Omnivore on Hackernews.\nThe main things that made me give it a shot were the fact is completely free (NO paid options at all for now), open source and that you can sign up with just email/password, you\u0026rsquo;re not forced to use your Google account or something similar like with many other similar apps.\nAnd: it has an official Obsidian plugin that let\u0026rsquo;s you import saved articles as nicely formatted markdown notes in Obsidian. You can specify exactly how you want the note to look, where you want it to be saved and what content should be shown - directly in the plugin settings in Obsidian.\nSo now I can comfortably move any article I find online into Obsidian with just one click - copy the specific parts of the article into some other note in Obsidian - and then just delete the auto generated note. From what I\u0026rsquo;ve seen so far while trying it out, notes that were synced once and then deleted or archived are not synced again, so my Obsidian vault won\u0026rsquo;t get cluttered with old articles from Omnivore.\nI still need to play around with this more (and there is the overall question how Omnivore wants to sustain it\u0026rsquo;s business - I guess they\u0026rsquo;ll have to add some paid features in the long run, hopefully things that just give you additional benefits and don\u0026rsquo;t downgrade the current experience. Then again, there is the option to self host your own Omnivore instance which could be an option if they ever start asking for money to use their own hosted version). But from a first look, it seems pretty great. I love the Obsidian integration, and the mobile \u0026amp; web app work fine and let you save articles with just one click and read them in there as well. Pretty happy with it.\n","title":"My Obsidian / Teuxdeux / Omnivore setup","url":"/my-obsidian-teuxdeux-omnivore-setup/"},{"content":"","title":"Omnivore","url":"/tags/omnivore/"},{"content":"","title":"Software","url":"/tags/software/"},{"content":"","title":"Teuxdeux","url":"/tags/teuxdeux/"},{"content":"I just noticed that it has been two years (8th of October 2021) since I\u0026rsquo;ve set up this website.

While I enjoy tinkering to a certain extent, at some point it just started to feel like I was spending too much time to achieve things in Neovim that I would get out of the box with other editors (Debugging being one of the bigger examples). I understand that other\u0026rsquo;s might have other usecases and needs and that Neovim might be a perfect fit for them, but I can now say that I\u0026rsquo;ve given Neovim (and Emacs previously) an honest shot, but for an actual IDE, it is just not for me.\nSo I\u0026rsquo;ve made the decision to give up on trying to use Neovim as my main IDE - I\u0026rsquo;ll be going back to VSCode - but instead I\u0026rsquo;m going to set it up to be just a fast \u0026amp; comfortable to use text editor, not specifically for writing code.\nThings I loved about Neovim I\u0026rsquo;m not going to stop using Neovim - there are a lot of things about it that I love and I\u0026rsquo;m definitely planning to keep using.\nSpeed - I don\u0026rsquo;t think I need to explain that one Keybindings - I\u0026rsquo;ve gotten very used to the keybindings, I\u0026rsquo;m using them in Obsidian, I\u0026rsquo;m using them at work in Visual Studio with the VSVim extension and I\u0026rsquo;m planning to try \u0026amp; set them up in VSCode as well Customizabilty - I can change every little thing I want (this can however also lead to getting distracted and messing around with the editor instead of actually working) Plugins - some plugins have really improved my workflow, for example there\u0026rsquo;s an Obsidian plugin for Neovim that makes navigating a Obsidian vault really comfortable, or just small plugins like Zenmode that remove distractions when working on a single file + obviously the endless theming options in Neovim Fuzzy finder \u0026amp; grep - probably the feature I miss the most in a lot of other editors, it\u0026rsquo;s just so fast find files and navigate to them.

So I thought I\u0026rsquo;d write a blog post about my plans and general ideas on how I want to want to achieve that.\nDecluttering my phone As my first step I decided to clean out my phone \u0026amp; uninstall all the apps that I found are unnecessary and taking up too much of my time or giving me too many notifications \u0026amp; distractions throughout the day.\nWhile I removed some apps like Twitch or Discord that would often interrupt me, I still haven\u0026rsquo;t managed to make myself uninstall Reddit because it\u0026rsquo;s my go-to app when I\u0026rsquo;m bored to be honest.\nI also set up the \u0026ldquo;always-on-display\u0026rdquo; on my phone to show me this sort of activity view that interrupts this colorful bar whenever you unlock and use your phone. So the more black space you have in this bar, the more you\u0026rsquo;ve been using your phone throughout the day.\nThe idea is that this will maybe just give me a little more incentive to not unlock my phone unless it\u0026rsquo;s actually necessary.\nAnalog note-taking Another idea that I\u0026rsquo;ve had is to try and move most of my note-taking to a paper notebook that I carry with me in my pocket. I\u0026rsquo;ve been carrying a little Moleskine notebook for more than a year now. So far I\u0026rsquo;ve been using it for random notes, shopping lists and to-do items and I want to really put more effort into using it more.\nMaybe I\u0026rsquo;ll even look into Rapid Logging in order to be more efficient with my note taking \u0026amp; have an easier time keeping track of notes over multiple days.\nThen every night, I could transfer the most important notes back to my Obsidian vault in order to have them backed up and searchable.\nComputer-only apps I\u0026rsquo;ve also decided to move some apps off my phone and use them exclusively on my computer instead. Two examples are as mentioned above Twitch and Discord. I don\u0026rsquo;t really need either app on my phone. Discord is something I mostly use when it comes to gaming which I do exclusively on my computer and Twitch just seems like an app that can easily distract me on my phone while I don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily mind having it open on a second screen on my computer while I\u0026rsquo;m doing something else.\nReading instead of random scrolling Reading has been a huge hobby for me throughout my life and now that I got a Kindle in 2018 I\u0026rsquo;ve been taking it a lot more seriously again.\nBy cutting down on random scrolling, I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to spend more time reading something I\u0026rsquo;m actually enjoying rather than just wasting time looking at random stuff online, for example on Reddit.\nOne screen at a time I\u0026rsquo;m also going to try and stick to looking at only one screen at a time. So for example if I\u0026rsquo;m watching a movie, I want to focus specifically on that without taking my phone out every now and then. Same goes for YouTube videos or while I\u0026rsquo;m reading.\nSpending some time without screens every day Lastly, I want to make it a conscious habit to spend some time away from screens every day.\nI\u0026rsquo;m already looking at a monitor for more than 8 hours per day during work and then obviously still a lot in my free time so I\u0026rsquo;m going to set a rule for myself to get away from any screens for a little bit every day. For example I could use my workouts as an easy way to make that happen \u0026amp; on rest days I could still go for a walk and either leave my phone at home or just use it to play an audiobook or music without actually taking it out of my pocket.\nThis post was mostly rambling but I feel like it helped to organize my thoughts about this topic. Let\u0026rsquo;s see how well I\u0026rsquo;ll actually be able to stick to my new goals.\n","title":"Digital Minimalism","url":"/digital-minimalism/"},{"content":"","title":"Minimalism","url":"/tags/minimalism/"},{"content":"","title":"Doom-Emacs","url":"/tags/doom-emacs/"},{"content":"After trying out Doom Emacs late last year and giving up on it, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to give it another try.\nDue to not really having an interesting programming pet project, last year I decided to try out a bunch of different editors. I went from NeoVim to LunarVim and SpaceVim, but after becoming frustrated while trying to get a comfortable setup using these editors, I gave Doom Emacs a shot.\nOut of the ones that I tried out, Doom Emacs definitely felt closest to being an editor that I could actually be productive with. However, after playing around with it and messing with the settings without giving it too much thought, I gave up on my new-editor-quest altogether.\nI really like the idea of Emacs / Doom Emacs though because it can be used with keyboard only \u0026amp; it feels like I\u0026rsquo;d be able to really customise my editor a lot and, once I\u0026rsquo;d learn and get used to the most important keyboard shortcuts, I could actually be faster navigating and editing code than with a \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; editor like VSCode for example.\nSetup I completely uninstalled my previous installation and deleted my old config files and installed Doom Emacs again from scratch. My current dotfiles for emacs can be found here. I basically went through all those files and set some basic settings in the init.el file and set my font \u0026amp; theme in the config.el file. So far I\u0026rsquo;m not using any other packages than the ones that already are bundled with Doom Emacs.\nNext steps I\u0026rsquo;m planning to watch the complete playlist of DoomCasts (maybe I\u0026rsquo;ll skip the org-mode part because I\u0026rsquo;m not really planning on using that).\nOther than that, I\u0026rsquo;m also going to be trying to use Doom Emacs as more or less my main editor so that I get more practice with it. I currently have some issues getting the Rust debugger to work correctly, but for the other languages I\u0026rsquo;m using it should be good to go. This way I\u0026rsquo;ll hopefully have a more gradual progress and won\u0026rsquo;t mess up my config files by messing with random settings but actually make more conscious choices when it comes to that.\n","title":"Giving Doom Emacs a second try","url":"/archive/giving-doom-emacs-a-second-try/"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been interested in personal knowledge base systems recently. After reading about several different ones, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to give Obsidian a shot \u0026amp; try moving all my existing notes there \u0026amp; set up an Obsidian vault from scratch.\nObsidian is a personal knowledge base that is based on markdown files. This is one of the main reasons why I wanted to give it a shot. While the software itself isn\u0026rsquo;t open source, it at least doesn\u0026rsquo;t use a proprietary format that would keep me locked into their system if they ever decide to give up development on the app.\nThe whole idea of Obsidian is to create links between notes in order to connect them by topic - this can then also be shown in a pretty fancy graph.\nFrom playing around with it a bit yesterday \u0026amp; today, I\u0026rsquo;m pretty impressed so far. It has a couple nice plugins + support for community plugins - for example I already have one installed for Git integration which lets me comfortably back up this whole vault to a private GitHub repository.\nI\u0026rsquo;m still deciding how to set it up in general \u0026amp; I want to make sure to only add notes \u0026amp; content that are actually still relevant to me now. I could probably also use Obsidian as my main way to write the content for this website - Hugo also uses Markdown files for the main content. So I could basically mirror everything on here \u0026amp; just publish the content that I\u0026rsquo;d actually want to be publicly accessible.\nI\u0026rsquo;m curious if I\u0026rsquo;ll actually stick to it and continue using it.

So I thought I\u0026rsquo;d write a recap on my chess progress over the last year and how I\u0026rsquo;m planning to work on improving my chess in the future.\nI made my account on Lichess in February of 2017 but only played 2 or 3 games on there before giving up on it. Then in spring/summer of 2020, partially due to the pandemic \u0026amp; the lockdowns, chess became really popular on Twitch \u0026amp; YouTube and the Chess.com website actually hosted an online chess tournament with some popular Twitch streamers called PogChamps.\nThis made me give chess a second try \u0026amp; I actually started enjoying it a lot. It has now become a big hobby for me \u0026amp; I play a couple of games pretty much daily.\nLichess to Chess.com \u0026amp; back to Lichess When I started playing again, I played around 130 games or so on Lichess, but then decided to switch to Chess.com as my main site (in part because those tournaments were all played on that site). So roughly from September 2020 to April 2021, I played pretty much exclusively on Chess.com. I even bought the Diamond premium membership which gave me unlimited puzzles and unlimited computer analysis of my games. Overall I played 390 games on there, mostly Rapid \u0026amp; Blitz games.\nAfter a while I noticed that actually overall prefered the UI on Lichess \u0026amp; basically all the features on the Diamond memberchip on Chess.com (unlimited puzzles, unlimited analysis, puzzle rush/streak) were available on Lichess for free so I decided not to continue my premium membership on Chess.com and switch back to Lichess.\nAnother thing that I love about Lichess is that it\u0026rsquo;s completely open source, has no paid features at all \u0026amp; is actually funded by a non-profit so they literally don\u0026rsquo;t need to try \u0026amp; monetize the features on the site.\nAs far as I know pretty much all new changes on the Lichess GitHub page are now written in Rust - maybe if I improve my Rust skills I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to help out there sometime. That would at least be an open source project that I\u0026rsquo;m really passionate about.\nMy progress over the last year On April 5th 2021 - right around the time when I switched back to Lichess, my ratings were:\nRapid: 1029 Blitz: 851 Puzzles: 1202 Bullet: 1029 (didn\u0026rsquo;t play Bullet for the first couple months) My ratings today, on 7th of May 2022 are:\nRapid: 1637 (+603) - my currently highest Rapid rating ever Blitz: 1327 (+476) - almost my highest ever (1330) Puzzles: 1773 (+571) Bullet: 1077 (+48) So in Rapid \u0026amp; Blitz I have been steadily making progress and improving my rating. I have the most games in Rapid (495 rated games), then Blitz (365 rated games) and then Bullet (210 rated games).\nOverall I\u0026rsquo;m putting my focus on Rapid chess, playing both the 10+5 \u0026amp; the 15+10 time controls. With Rapid chess I at least feel like my wins are actually earned because with the increment, games hardly ever end in flagging my opponent \u0026amp; winning on time.\nRecently I\u0026rsquo;ve however also enjoyed Bullet chess, but this is mostly just for the adrenaline of the quick time control ( I play 2+1) - I know that playing Bullet won\u0026rsquo;t really help me to improve a lot.\nWhat I\u0026rsquo;m working on currently While I have been improving overall, I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m often getting out of the opening in a worse position than my opponent because I\u0026rsquo;m mostly winging it and just playing moves that look good \u0026amp; develop my pieces.\nThis is why I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to start actually working on my openings. I want to find at least one opening for white and one for black on which I can focus and really learn well. My notes while learning the openings can be found here.\nUnrelated, but today I found this fun website made by a fan of one of my favorite chess streamers/youtubers, Eric Rosen that analyzes all your games on Lichess and gives you a score based on how many fancy types of checkmates you managed to do, stalemate tricks, weird pawn structures and just generally fun achievements. It\u0026rsquo;s called Rosen Score. I got 27 \u0026ldquo;Rosen trophies\u0026rdquo; there :D\n","title":"My chess progress","url":"/my-chess-progress/"},{"content":"","title":"Hugo","url":"/tags/hugo/"},{"content":"","title":"Website","url":"/tags/website/"},{"content":"Some ideas for content that I want to put on this website:\nTo-Do a digital cv - either just hosting a PDF or writing some custom css to format everything nicely changelog for this website maybe a page about this website in general and why I created it / why I\u0026rsquo;m using it add ways to contact me (maybe /contact page) add a page for my to-read list general clean-up of the archetypes, layouts and css maybe switch to just having a thicker separator between menu and main content, maybe also show all page titles in uppercase try grouping the books on the reading page by year, with a little header for each year find a way to add tags to blog posts \u0026amp; notes and make them searchable add reading time to blog posts add all bigger changes to this website to the changelog page and delete the unnecessary blog posts Done a personal blog page with information about myself a reading list \u0026amp; place to review books I\u0026rsquo;ve read, basically an online library / bookshelf, maybe a way to replace my Goodreads account programming side projects a custom bookmarks page for websites and links I commonly use (maybe just one big html table) page for random notes maybe switch the domain to \u0026ldquo;matkv.dev\u0026rdquo; (when my current domain runs out, so probably in October?) + I could keep my current domain, especially for the e-mail and just forward to the website on the new domain ","title":"Website Improvements","url":"/archive/website-improvements/"},{"content":"I changed the domain for this website!

My solution is a bit hacky but it works.\nThis is how the menu currently looks in my config.toml file.\n[menu] [[menu.main]] identifier = \u0026#34;home\u0026#34; name = \u0026#34;home\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;/\u0026#34; weight = 10 [[menu.main]] identifier = \u0026#34;about\u0026#34; name = \u0026#34;about\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;/about\u0026#34; weight = 20 [[menu.main]] identifier = \u0026#34;blog\u0026#34; name = \u0026#34;blog\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;/blog\u0026#34; weight = 30 [[menu.main]] identifier = \u0026#34;projects\u0026#34; name = \u0026#34;projects\u0026#34; url = \u0026#34;/projects\u0026#34; weight = 40 In my navigation.html I already had my range function that goes through all those elements in the menu and creates a list item \u0026amp; link for them.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s new now is that I added a check to see if the URL property of the current menu item is the same as RelPermalink property of the current page. I\u0026rsquo;ve found several other ways to do this online but haven\u0026rsquo;t managed to get them to work.\n{{ $current := . }} {{ range .Site.Menus.main }} {{ $active := false}} {{ $trimmedperma := trim $current.RelPermalink \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;}} {{ $trimmedurl := trim .URL \u0026#34;/\u0026#34;}} {{ $active := or $active (eq $trimmedperma $trimmedurl)}} So if the current menu is for example the blog page, the URL of the menu item will be \u0026ldquo;/blog\u0026rdquo; and the permalink of the page will have the same value. (I had to trim the slashes to make the comparison cleaner). If that is true, the $active variable will be set to true.\nFor the actual menu item, I added an if clause that checks if the ``$active``` variable is set and then adds a css class to the link tag of the item. The css class just has a rule to set the font to bold.\nclass=\u0026#34;{{ if $active }}navigation-active{{ end }}\u0026#34; This alone would however not work if I would for example open up a specific blog post or a project from my projects list. For this I also needed to check if the section of the current page is the correct one - a blog or a project.\n{{ $active := or $active (and (eq $trimmedurl \u0026#34;blog\u0026#34;) (eq $current.Section \u0026#34;blog\u0026#34;)) }} {{ $active := or $active (and (eq $trimmedurl \u0026#34;projects\u0026#34;) (eq $current.Section \u0026#34;projects\u0026#34;)) }} Now, the menu items stays bold even when I open up a specific blog post or project post. I\u0026rsquo;ll have to update this spot whenever I add a new archetype that has lists/subpages that can be opened.\nWhile writing this blogpost I also finally managed to set up a basic version of the syntax highlighting using chroma and Pygments \u0026amp; managed to make it work so that it uses a different color scheme when I switch between dark and light mode. I used this tutorial as a general guide but my implementation is basically done the same way as the dark mode / light mode switch works.\nIf I ever want to change a color scheme, I can just generate it using this command:\nhugo gen chromastyles --style=friendly \u0026gt; path/to/cssfile/filename.css Then I can basically just switch out the content of my current static/css/syntaxlight.css and static/css/syntaxdark.css files and easily use a different color scheme.\nBut I\u0026rsquo;m definitely not motivated enough to write all of that down in this post :D\n","title":"Mark active menu bold in Hugo","url":"/archive/mark-active-menu-bold-in-hugo/"},{"content":"I\u0026rsquo;ve been struggling to find a programming side project that I am really passionate about.
