It is also remarkable how realistic and brave he stayed during his illness and the book also shows how the diagnosis changed the lives of not only him but also his wife.</p><p>I would absolutely recommend this book, I loved it.</p></div><div class=book-dateread>Finished: 24 October 2021</div><br><div class=separator><hr></div><br><div class=book-title>Lolita</div><div class=book-details>Vladimir Nabokov (1955)</div><div class=book-rating>★★★☆☆</div><div class=book-review><p>My first book by Nabokov. My main thoughts: super pretty and flowery writing style - sometimes hard to read for me as a non native English speaker (then again neither was Nabokov).</p><p>My main problem with the book wasn&rsquo;t even the obviously problematic/disturbing relationship between the two main characters but mostly that I just didn&rsquo;t really care for the story at some point. I actually took a break of several months before finally finishing this book. There are definitely some quite fucked up scenes & situations in the book; I also didn&rsquo;t think that this book is in any way romanticizing the relationship of the two characters. Humbert knows what he&rsquo;s doing and that what he is doing isn&rsquo;t right, it&rsquo;s just the fact that he&rsquo;s an unreliable narrator that might make this a bit less clear I guess.</p><p>Overall, I found it okay. Very pretty writing style, didn&rsquo;t love the story & probably won&rsquo;t reread it.</p></div><div class=book-dateread>Finished: 1 October 2021</div><br><div class=separator><hr></div><br><div class=book-title>Man's Search for Meaning</div><div class=book-details>Viktor E. Frankl (1946)</div><div class=book-rating>★★★★★</div><div class=book-review><p>The first part of the book describes the experiences of the author during his imprisonment in several concentration camps and talks about dealing with the situation there and finding a reason to accept & continue enduring his suffering there. Obviously some very disturbing & tragic description of events there.</p><p>The second part was about his general philosophy called Logotherapy. This was definitely more dry, but I liked that for every statement or idea he usually gave several examples of actual cases that prove and explain that idea in a more practical sense.</p><p>Overall I found it super interesting & it definitely changes one&rsquo;s outlook on life&rsquo;s meaning to a certain extent. Great book!</p></div><div class=book-dateread>Finished: 21 September 2021</div><br><div class=separator><hr></div><br><div class=book-title>Meditations</div><div class=book-details>Marcus Aurelius (180)</div><div class=book-rating>★★★☆☆</div><div class=book-review><p>This is my first introduction to stoicism and actually the first book on philosophy in general that I read. I read the Gregory Hayes translation which helped a lot - I first tried an older translation that was unecessarily difficult to understand when you&rsquo;re used to modern English.</p><p>I found many of the ideas in the book quite interesting and insightful even though I don&rsquo;t agree with all of them. At times the book was quite dry & repetitive but I guess that is to be expected when talking about this topic. Overall I liked it and it was neat to actually read the private notes of a Roman emperor that lived almost 2000 years ago. You don&rsquo;t get to do that every day.</p></div><div class=book-dateread>Finished: 9 September 2021</div><br><div class=separator><hr></div><br><div class=book-title>Cunk on Everything: The Encyclopedia Philomena</div><div class=book-details>Jason Hazeley (2018)</div><div class=book-rating>★★★☆☆</div><div class=book-review><p>Funny concept but overall it wasn&rsquo;t really my type of humor.
