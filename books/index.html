However I have been reading some other books on the side too. I have now decided to fully focus on the Wheel Of Time because I&rsquo;m actually just a third of the way done with the whole series :D</p><p>According to Wikipedia, it is the longest book of The Wheel Of Time series even though it has fewer pages than Lord of Chaos (393 823 words).</p><p>In this book the main characters are (once again) split up. Rand goes to the Aiel Waste to learn more about the Aiel and get accepted by them as the Dragon Reborn, Egwene and Moirane/Lan also join them because Egwene is trying to improve her abilities of Dreamwalking. Perrin returns to the Two Rivers to deal with the Whitecloaks & the Trollocs (with Faile & Loial) and Nynaeve & Elayne are dealing with the Black Ajah in Tear.</p><p>Overall I really enjoyed most of the storylines and felt that the pacing was better compared to the previous books. I still really like the relationships between Faile & Perrin and Nynaeve and Elayne & co, there was also a pretty wild storyline with Tar Valon & Siuan Sanche that is now continued in book 5 as I&rsquo;m reading it.</p><p>To summarise: really solid, I liked it & I&rsquo;m curious to see where to story will go next (Still haven&rsquo;t read any major spoilers so far :D)</p></div></div><div class=book-review><div class=header><div class=date>Jul 2022</div><div class=rating><span class=rating-stars><span class=circle></span>

I started it once early last year but actually gave up on it because the story just didn&rsquo;t click with me.
Gave it another shot this year but I still struggled with it in the beginning. I tried listening to the audiobook for a bit (narrated by Carey Mulligan, loved her narration) which helped to at least get far enough into the story to keep going & finish it.</p><p>The book tells the story of Nora Seed who, after a suicide attempt, ends up in &ldquo;The Midnight Library&rdquo;, a place between life and death. There she meets Mrs. Elm, a librarian that cared for her during her childhood. She gets to experience all the lives she could have lived if she took different decisions throughout her life by picking a book from the shelves of this library. We see how her decisions shaped the lives of the people around her in all those parralell lives & how experiencing all those lives shaped her attitude towards life in general.</p><p>Overall it was nice, not blown away by it but I did enjoy the ending & the writing style was also enjoyable.

become independent. The book follows its thoughts now that it has to deal with social awkwardness, its pessimistic worldview and the human clients on
whose mission it has to protect them.</p><p>Murderbot has such a fun personality, constantly complaining about
not being able to spend its time watching entertainment shows and trying avoiding any interaction with humans.</p><p>Really cute concept & it&rsquo;s overall a lighthearted & very short book so it was easy to finish. I&rsquo;ll probably give the other books in the series a shot! Would definitely recommend it!</p></div></div><div class=book-review><div class=header><div class=date>Apr 2022</div><div class=rating><span class=rating-stars><span class=circle></span>

to be super interesting.</p><p>It gives an overview and a basic introduction to the history & the main ideas in Stoicism, clears up some misconceptions that people might
have about this philosophy and then describes how the most important stoics came up with their ideas and how we can
apply them in our daily lives.</p><p>I&rsquo;d definitely recommend this book to anyone trying to learn more about Stoicism, I actually wish that I had read it

There are definitely some quite fucked up scenes & situations in the book; I also didn&rsquo;t think that this book is in any way romanticizing the relationship of the two characters.

In general the ending was kind of spoiled or at least too predictable by the synopsis and general descriptions of the book.</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t have the deep emotional impact on me as it seems to have on a lot of readers but I would overall still absolutely recommend it.</p></div></div><div class=book-review><div class=header><div class=date>May 2019</div><div class=rating><span class=rating-stars><span class=circle></span>
