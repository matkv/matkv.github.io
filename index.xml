My main goals are:
Automate the setup process as much as possible so that I can easily reuse my configuration on a different computer. Setup an built-in file browser and a nice theme (maybe the palenight theme) Setup code completion for my most used languages, maybe try C# first TO-DO</description></item><item><title>Custom Project Type</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/blog/custom-project-type/</link><pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 2021 23:15:55 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/blog/custom-project-type/</guid><description>I just finally finished creating a custom type for projects. I&amp;rsquo;ll quickly document what I did so that I don&amp;rsquo;t forget it again.
Hugo basically looks in the &amp;ldquo;theme/matkv/archetypes&amp;rdquo; directory to figure out what kind of content types exist for the site.
So I created a new archetype for my projects. I created a subfolder called &amp;ldquo;projects&amp;rdquo; and in this folder there is another subfolder &amp;ldquo;image&amp;rdquo; which will be used for a cover image for each project, and then just an &amp;ldquo;index.</description></item><item><title>First Post</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/blog/first-post/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Oct 2021 20:46:26 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/blog/first-post/</guid><description>This is my first blog post. I am not sure what exactly I will be using this blog for, but for now my main goal is to improve the design and functionality of this website.
This is also my first time setting up a custom domain so I am just learning and trying out stuff.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/about/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m Matko, a 27 year old software engineer from Austria. Apart from technology, my biggest interests are music (I play piano &amp;amp; guitar), exercising (running &amp;amp; strength training), reading and recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been getting into chess.
On this page I plan to show some basic information about me &amp;amp; probably a digital CV that describes my education and my past and current workplaces.
This page is still under construction, the css for the timeline below behaves weirdly on devices with small screens.</description></item><item><title>Habit Tracker</title><link>https://matkv.github.io/projects/habit-tracker/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://matkv.github.io/projects/habit-tracker/</guid><description>A Flutter app which lets the user create habits, tasks and events.
