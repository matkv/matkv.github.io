Since then I&rsquo;ve been on the journey of going through this book series - so here is a short status update on my current progress.</p><p>It is almost the end of July 2023, and I&rsquo;m just about to start with the 11th book of the series - &ldquo;Knife of Dreams&rdquo;. As expected, finishing the series is taking quite some time. I just finished the prequel book &ldquo;New Spring&rdquo; a week ago and now I&rsquo;m down to the last four books.</p><p>When starting out I was constantly reading other books on the side too - in 2021 when I started, only 2 out of the 17 books I read were WoT books, in 2022 it was 5 out of 13 books. But I noticed that doing it this way would just take too much time in general and so in the second half of 2022 I decided to <strong>fully focus on finishing the series</strong> and read these books exclusively.</p><p>While I&rsquo;ve been enjoying the series so far, there definitely have been certain books that felt quite slow and dragged on a bit too long for my taste, especially the 10th book - &ldquo;Crossroads of Twilight&rdquo; was one that just took me quite long to finish, especially when considering that it&rsquo;s actually one of the shorter books.</p><p>Now that I read &ldquo;New Spring&rdquo; - which was actually pretty nice and a welcome break from the main story - I&rsquo;m really looking forward to the last 4 books. When looking at some of the ratings on Goodreads (even though those can be hit or miss), they should be pretty great (even though all of them are still chonkers).</p><p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I think The Wheel of Time has been enjoyable so far, but I am <strong>really</strong> looking forward finally being done with it and reading some other stuff again. I think I want to focus on shorter books and try to read <em>wide</em> - different authors, genres & just generally try to explore a bigger variety of topics. I want to go through more of the classics but also read some contemporary books & more non-fiction.</p><p>My To-Read list is pretty big now (just checked, 297 books at least) so I&rsquo;m ready to tackle that, hopefully soon.</p><br><div class=blogbacktolist><a href=/blog>« Back to overview</a></div></div><div class=footer><p>© 2023 | matkv</p></div></body></html>
