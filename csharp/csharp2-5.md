## C# 2

### Generics

Generics allow us to write general-purpose code thats type-safe (compiler validates the types) at compile-time using the same type in multiple places without knowing what that type is beforehand.

They are most heavily used in:

* Collections
* Delegates, particularly in LINQ
* Asynchronous code, ```Task<T>``` is a promise of a future value of type ```T```
* Nullable value types

#### Collections before generics

.NET 1 had three broad kinds of collections:

* Arrays -> direct language and runtime support, size is fixed at initialization
* Object-based collections -> Values are described in the API by using System.Object, no collection-specific language or runtime support, but language features such as indexers and ```foreach``` statements can be used with them. Examples: ```ArrayList``` & ```Hashtable```.
* Specialized collections -> Values are described in the API with a specific type, and the collection can only be used for that type. Example: ```StringCollection``` -> API looks like ```ArrayList``` but using ```String``` instead of ```Object``` for anything referring to a value.

Arrays & specialized collections are **statically typed**. The API prevents us from putting the wrong kind of value in a collection.

**Example:**

Let's say we want to create a collection of strings in one method (GenerateNames), and print them out in another method (PrintNames).

Doing it with arrays:

```csharp
static string[] GenerateNames()
{
  string[] names = new string[4];
  names[0] = "Gamma";
  names[1] = "Vlissides";
  names[2] = "Johnson";
  names[3] = "Helm";
  return names;
}

static void PrintNames(string[] names)
{
  foreach (string name in names)
  {
    Console.WriteLine(name);
  }
}
```

This isn't ideal, because we have to know exactly how many names there will be. Either finding out before we create the array or always creating a bigger one and copying the contents of earlier smaller arrays.

A type that keeps track of the size is the ```ArrayList```.

```csharp
static ArrayList GenerateNames()
{
  ArrayList names = new ArrayList();
  names.Add("Gamma");
  names.Add("Vlissides");
  names.Add("Johnson");
  names.Add("Helm");
  return names;
}

static void PrintNames(ArrayList names)
{
  foreach (string name in names)
  {
    Console.WriteLine(name);
  }
}
```

While this is cleaner because we don't need to know the amount of names beforehand, the big problem is that there's nothing that stops us from adding a nonstring to the collection. The type of the ```ArrayList-Add``` parameter is just ```Object```.

Also, ```PrintNames``` can contain any kind of object reference. If we tried to print types that can't be printed we'd get an error, yet nothing checks whether the type is a correct one.

One way of solving this would be using a ```StringCollection```as the return type of the ```GenerateNames()``` method & taking a ```StringCollection``` parameter in ```PrintNames```.

This would solve the errors mentioned above and would be great if we would always need strings. But if we needed a collection of some other type we'd either have to find a suitable collection framework or write it ourselves.

#### Using generics instead

```List<T>``` is a generic type. It is a collection in which ```T``` is the element type of the collection.

```csharp
static List<string> GenerateNames()
{
  List<string> names = new List<string>();
  names.Add("Gamma");
  names.Add("Vlissides");
  names.Add("Johnson");
  names.Add("Helm");
  return names;
}

static void PrintNames(List<string> names)
{
  foreach (string name in names)
  {
    Console.WriteLine(name);
  }
}
```

This solves all the previous problems:

* We don't need to know the size of the collection beforehand
* We get compile-time error if we try to use anything other than a ```List<string>```
* We can change the element type without having to worry about generating code and and having to manage it

##### Type parameters and type arguments

Parameter -> inputs declared by the method
Arguments -> are provided by calling code - in the form of arguments

```csharp
public static void Method(string name, int value) {} //string name & int value are parameters

Method(customerName, 5) //customername is the Argument for the "name" parameter
```

In generics, we have ```type parameters``` and ```type arguments``` - which are the same idea but applied to types. The declaration of a generic type or method includes type parameters in angle brackets after the name.

```csharp
public class List<T>  //T is the type parameter
{
  ...
}

List<String> list = new List<string>(); //<string> is the type argument
```

A list has an ```Add(T item)``` method. If we for example try to type "list.Add(" into Visual Studio, IntelliSense will prompt us as if the the ```item``` parameter has been declared with a type of string. If we try to pass an argument of another type, there will be a compile time error. 

Methods can be generic as well.
