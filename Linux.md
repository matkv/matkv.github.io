### Manjaro Linux

#### Pamac

Pamac is an easier to use package manager than the default one called Octopi. In its preferences, in the AUR tab, we can easily enable the AUR repository. Once it is installed, Octopi can be removed by selecting all the Octopi packages in Pamac and right clicking -> Remove.

#### Installing & enabling a firewall

Manjaro does not have a graphical utility installed for the firewall. Open pamac and search for gufw package and install it. In order to be able to run it in our desktop environment (KDE Plasma for example), we need to edit the /bin/gufw file.

```bash
sudo nano /bin/gufw
```

Add this line (Ctrl+O to save, Ctrl+X to close):

```bash
kdesu python3 /usr/lib/python3.7/site-packages/gufw/gufw.py
```
Then we can open the GUI program for the firewall. For most users, just enabling the Firewall is enough.

#### Enable trim for SSD's

TRIM is a program that helps to clean blocks in your SSD and thus use it more efficiently and extend the SSD’s life. Many computers today have an SSD, if this is your case, then enabling TRIM is one thing you need to do after installing Manjaro.

To enable TRIM on Manjaro, run the following command in a terminal:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable fstrim.timer
```

#### Remove Orphans (Unused) packages

When you install and remove different packages, sometimes there are some packages which remain on your system but they are not used by any program. They are the Orphans packages. To save space on our hard drive, it’s a good idea to uninstall them.

First, open pamac. Next, go to the Installed section and finally go to Orphans section. Pamac will show all the orphan packages and we can remove them there.

#### Backups

You will find many tools for backing up Manjaro, but the easiest option to use is **Dèjá Dup Backup Tool**. Using this tool, it is possible to select which folders should be backed up, set up a shedule and even save them on Google Drive if desired.
